&quot;The anarchists were unanimous in subjecting authoritarian socialism to a barrage of severe criticism. At the time when they made violent and satirical attacks these were not entirely well founded, for those to whom they were addressed were either primitive or &quot;vulgar&quot; communists, whose thought had not yet been fertilized by Marxist humanism, or else, in the case of Marx and Engels themselves, were not as set on authority and state control as the anarchists made out.&quot; Daniel Guerin, ''[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/daniel-guerin-anarchism-from-theory-to-practice#toc2 Anarchism: From Theory to Practice]'' (New York: Monthly Review Press, 1970)

To extend this mechanism to larger groups, two basic principles must be followed:

* Starting with an &quot;empty&quot; key consisting only of ''g'', the secret is made by raising the current value to every participant’s private exponent once, in any order (the first such exponentiation yields the participant’s own public key).
* Any intermediate value (having up to ''N''-1 exponents applied, where ''N'' is the number of participants in the group) may be revealed publicly, but the final value (having had all ''N'' exponents applied) constitutes the shared secret and hence must never be revealed publicly. Thus, each user must obtain their copy of the secret by applying their own private key last (otherwise there would be no way for the last contributor to communicate the final key to its recipient, as that last contributor would have turned the key into the very secret the group wished to protect).

These principles leave open various options for choosing in which order participants contribute to keys. The simplest and most obvious solution is to arrange the ''N'' participants in a circle and have ''N'' keys rotate around the circle, until eventually every key has been contributed to by all ''N'' participants (ending with its owner) and each participant has contributed to ''N'' keys (ending with their own). However, this requires that every participant perform ''N'' modular exponentiations.

By choosing a more optimal order, and relying on the fact that keys can be duplicated, it is possible to reduce the number of modular exponentiations performed by each participant to {{nowrap|log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''N'') + 1}} using a [[Divide and conquer algorithms|divide-and-conquer-style]] approach, given here for eight participants:

# Participants A, B, C, and D each perform one exponentiation, yielding ''g&lt;sup&gt;abcd&lt;/sup&gt;''; this value is sent to E, F, G, and H. In return, participants A, B, C, and D receive ''g&lt;sup&gt;efgh&lt;/sup&gt;''.
# Participants A and B each perform one exponentiation, yielding ''g&lt;sup&gt;efghab&lt;/sup&gt;'', which they send to C and D, while C and D do the same, yielding ''g&lt;sup&gt;efghcd&lt;/sup&gt;'', which they send to A and B.
# Participant A performs an exponentiation, yielding ''g&lt;sup&gt;efghcda&lt;/sup&gt;'', which it sends to B; similarly, B sends ''g&lt;sup&gt;efghcdb&lt;/sup&gt;'' to A. C and D do similarly.
# Participant A performs one final exponentiation, yielding the secret ''g&lt;sup&gt;efghcdba&lt;/sup&gt;'' = ''g&lt;sup&gt;abcdefgh&lt;/sup&gt;'', while B does the same to get ''g&lt;sup&gt;efghcdab&lt;/sup&gt;'' = ''g&lt;sup&gt;abcdefgh&lt;/sup&gt;''; again, C and D do similarly.
# Participants E through H simultaneously perform the same operations using ''g&lt;sup&gt;abcd&lt;/sup&gt;'' as their starting point.

Once this operation has been completed all participants will possess the secret ''g&lt;sup&gt;abcdefgh&lt;/sup&gt;'', but each participant will have performed only four modular exponentiations, rather than the eight implied by a simple circular arrangement.

==Security==
The protocol is considered secure against eavesdroppers if ''G'' and ''g'' are chosen properly. In particular, the order of the group G must be large, particularly if the same group is used for large amounts of traffic. The eavesdropper (&quot;[[Alice and Bob|Eve]]&quot;) has to solve the [[Diffie–Hellman problem]] to obtain ''g''&lt;sup&gt;''ab''&lt;/sup&gt;. This is currently considered difficult for groups whose order is large enough. An efficient algorithm to solve the [[discrete logarithm problem]] would make it easy to compute ''a'' or ''b'' and solve the Diffie–Hellman problem, making this and many other public key cryptosystems insecure.  Fields of small characteristic may be less secure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first1=Razvan | last1=Barbulescu | first2=Pierrick | last2=Gaudry | first3=Antoine | last3=Joux | first4=Emmanuel | last4=Thomé  | title=A Heuristic Quasi-Polynomial Algorithm for Discrete Logarithm in Finite Fields of Small Characteristic | work=Lecture Notes in Computer Science | book-title=Advances in Cryptology – EUROCRYPT 2014 | conference=Proceedings 33rd Annual International Conference on the Theory and Applications of Cryptographic Techniques | location=Copenhagen, Denmark | volume=8441 | date=2014 | pages=1–16 | doi=10.1007/978-3-642-55220-5_1 | isbn=978-3-642-55220-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Order (group theory)|order]] of ''G'' should have a large prime factor to prevent use of the [[Pohlig–Hellman algorithm]] to obtain ''a'' or ''b''. For this reason, a [[Sophie Germain prime]] ''q'' is sometimes used to calculate {{nowrap|1=''p'' = 2''q'' + 1}}, called a [[safe prime]], since the order of ''G'' is then only divisible by 2 and ''q''. ''g'' is then sometimes chosen to generate the order ''q'' subgroup of ''G'', rather than ''G'', so that the [[Legendre symbol]] of ''g&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;'' never reveals the low order bit of ''a''. A protocol using such a choice is for example [[Internet Key Exchange|IKEv2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=RFC 4306 Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2) Protocol |publisher=Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) |author=C. Kaufman (Microsoft) |date=December 2005 |url=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4306.txt }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''g'' is often a small integer such as 2. Because of the [[random self-reducibility]] of the discrete logarithm problem a small ''g'' is equally secure as any other generator of the same group.

If Alice and Bob use [[random number generator]]s whose outputs are not completely random and can be predicted to some extent, then Eve's task is much easier.

In the original description, the Diffie–Hellman exchange by itself does not provide [[authentication]] of the communicating parties and is thus vulnerable to a [[man-in-the-middle attack]]. [[Alice and Bob|Mallory]] may establish two distinct key exchanges, one with Alice and the other with Bob, effectively masquerading as Alice to Bob, and vice versa, allowing her to decrypt, then re-encrypt, the messages passed between them. Note that Mallory must continue to be in the middle, transferring messages every time Alice and Bob communicate. If she is ever absent, her previous presence is then revealed to Alice and Bob. They will know that all of their private conversations had been intercepted and decoded by someone in the channel.

A method to authenticate the communicating parties to each other is generally needed to prevent this type of attack. Variants of Diffie–Hellman, such as [[Station-to-Station protocol|STS protocol]], may be used instead to avoid these types of attacks.

===Practical attacks on Internet traffic===
The [[number field sieve]] algorithm, which is generally the most effective in solving the [[discrete logarithm problem]], consists of four computational steps. The first three steps only depend on the order of the group G, not on the specific number whose finite log is desired.&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield Diffie, Paul C. Van Oorschot, and Michael J. Wiener &quot;Authentication and Authenticated Key Exchanges&quot;, in Designs, Codes and Cryptography, 2, 107-125 (1992), Section 5.2, available as Appendix B to {{US patent|5724425}}&lt;/ref&gt; It turns out that much Internet traffic uses one of a handful of groups that are of order 1024&amp;nbsp;bits or less.&lt;ref&gt;https://weakdh.org/imperfect-forward-secrecy-ccs15.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; By [[precomputing]] the first three steps of the number field sieve for the most common groups, an attacker need only carry out the last step, which is much less computationally expensive than the first three steps, to obtain a specific logarithm. The [[Logjam (computer security)|Logjam]] attack used this vulnerability to compromise a variety of Internet services that allowed the use of groups whose order was a 512-bit prime number, so called [[export of cryptography|export grade]]. The authors needed several thousand CPU cores for a week to precompute data for a single 512-bit prime. Once that was done, however, individual logarithms could be solved in about a minute using two 18-core Intel Xeon CPUs.&lt;ref name=imperfectfs/&gt;

As estimated by the authors behind the Logjam attack, the much more difficult precomputation needed to solve the discrete log problem for a 1024-bit prime would cost on the order of $100 million, well within the budget of large national [[intelligence agency]] such as the U.S. [[National Security Agency]] (NSA). The Logjam authors speculate that precomputation against widely reused 1024-bit D–H primes is behind claims in [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|leaked NSA documents]] that NSA is able to break much of current cryptography.&lt;ref name=imperfectfs/&gt;

To avoid these vulnerabilities, authors recommend use of [[elliptic curve cryptography]], for which no similar attack is known. Failing that, they recommend that the order, ''p'', of the Diffie–Hellman group should be at least 2048&amp;nbsp;bits. They estimate that the pre-computation required for a 2048-bit prime is 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; more difficult than for 1024-bit primes.&lt;ref name=imperfectfs&gt;{{cite web |last1=Adrian |first1=David |last2=Bhargavan |first2=Karthikeyan |last3=Durumeric |first3=Zakir |last4=Gaudry |first4=Pierrick |last5=Green |first5=Matthew |last6=Halderman |first6=J. Alex |last7=Heninger |first7=Nadia |last8=Springall |first8=Drew |last9=Thomé |first9=Emmanuel |last10=Valenta |first10=Luke |last11=VanderSloot |first11=Benjamin |last12=Wustrow |first12=Eric |last13=Zanella-Béguelin |first13=Santiago |last14=Zimmermann |first14=Paul  |title=Imperfect Forward Secrecy: How Diffie-Hellman Fails in Practice |url=https://weakdh.org/imperfect-forward-secrecy-ccs15.pdf |date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If NSA is breaking Diffie–Hellman, but has not pushed for US sites to upgrade to longer keys, then it would be an example of NSA's [[NOBUS]] policy of not closing security holes that NSA believes only they can exploit.

==Other uses==

===Encryption===

Public key encryption schemes based on the Diffie–Hellman key exchange have been proposed. The first such scheme is the [[ElGamal encryption]]. A more modern variant is the [[Integrated Encryption Scheme]].

===Forward secrecy===

Protocols that achieve [[forward secrecy]] generate new key pairs for each [[session (computer science)|session]] and discard them at the end of the session.
The Diffie–Hellman key exchange is a frequent choice for such protocols, because of its fast key generation.

===Password-authenticated key agreement===

When Alice and Bob share a password, they may use a [[password-authenticated key agreement]] (PK) form of Diffie–Hellman to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. One simple scheme is to compare the [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of '''s''' concatenated with the password calculated independently on both ends of channel. A feature of these schemes is that an attacker can only test one specific password on each iteration with the other party, and so the system provides good security with relatively weak passwords. This approach is described in [[ITU-T]] Recommendation [[X.1035]], which is used by the [[G.hn]] home networking standard.

An example of such a protocol is the [[Secure Remote Password Protocol]].

===Public key===
It is also possible to use Diffie–Hellman as part of a [[public key infrastructure]], allowing Bob to encrypt a message so that only Alice will be able to decrypt it, with no prior communication between them other than Bob having trusted knowledge of Alice's public key. Alice's public key is &lt;math&gt;(g^a \bmod{p}, g, p)&lt;/math&gt;. To send her a message, Bob chooses a random ''b'' and then sends Alice &lt;math&gt;g^b \bmod p&lt;/math&gt; (un-encrypted) together with the message encrypted with symmetric key &lt;math&gt;(g^a)^b \bmod{p}&lt;/math&gt;. Only Alice can determine the symmetric key and hence decrypt the message because only she has ''a'' (the private key). A pre-shared public key also prevents man-in-the-middle attacks.

In practice, Diffie–Hellman is not used in this way, with [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] being the dominant public key algorithm. This is largely for historical and commercial reasons{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}, namely that [[RSA (security firm)|RSA Security]] created a certificate authority for key signing that became [[Verisign]]. Diffie–Hellman cannot be used to sign certificates. However, the [[ElGamal signature scheme|ElGamal]] and [[Digital Signature Algorithm|DSA]] signature algorithms are mathematically related to it, as well as [[MQV]], [[Station-to-Station protocol|STS]] and the [[Internet key exchange|IKE]] component of the [[IPsec]] protocol suite for securing [[Internet Protocol]] communications.

'''''Destry Rides Again''''' is a 1939 [[Western (genre)|western]] starring [[Marlene Dietrich]] and [[James Stewart]], and directed by [[George Marshall (director)|George Marshall]]. The supporting cast includes [[Mischa Auer]], [[Charles Winninger]], [[Brian Donlevy]], [[Allen Jenkins]], [[Irene Hervey]], [[Billy Gilbert]], [[Bill Cody, Jr.]], [[Lillian Yarbo]], and [[Una Merkel]]. Although the title comes from [[Max Brand]]'s [[Destry Rides Again (novel)|popular novel]], which inspired the earlier screenplay with [[Tom Mix]], this version is almost entirely unrelated to either.

In 1996, ''Destry Rides Again'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
[[File:Destry-Rides-Again-1939.jpg|thumb|300px|left|[[James Stewart]] and [[Marlene Dietrich]] in ''Destry Rides Again'']]
Saloon owner Kent ([[Brian Donlevy]]), the unscrupulous boss of the fictional [[Wild West|Western]] town of Bottleneck, has the town's sheriff, Keogh, killed when Keogh asks one too many questions about a rigged poker game. Kent and &quot;Frenchy&quot; ([[Marlene Dietrich]]), his girlfriend and the dance hall queen, now have a stranglehold over the local cattle ranchers. The crooked town's mayor, Hiram J. Slade ([[Samuel S. Hinds]]), who is in collusion with Kent, appoints the town drunk, Washington Dimsdale ([[Charles Winninger]]), as the new sheriff, assuming that he will be easy to control and manipulate. But what the mayor does not know is that Dimsdale was a deputy under the famous lawman, Tom Destry, and is able to call upon the latter's equally formidable son, Tom Destry, Jr. ([[James Stewart]]), to help him make Bottleneck a lawful, respectable town. 

Destry confounds the townsfolk by refusing to strap on a gun in spite of demonstrating that he is an expert marksman. He still carries out the &quot;letter of the law&quot;, as deputy sheriff, and earns their respect. A final confrontation between Destry and Kent's gang is inevitable, but &quot;Frenchy&quot; is won over by Destry and changes sides. A final gunfight ensues where Frenchy is killed in the [[crossfire]], and the rule of law wins the day.

==Songs==
Dietrich sings &quot;[[See What the Boys in the Back Room Will Have]]&quot; and &quot;You've Got That Look&quot;, written by [[Frank Loesser]], set to music by [[Frederick Hollander]], which have become classics.

==Production==
[[File:Marshall-Dietrich-Pasternak in Destry Rides Again.jpg|thumb|260px|right|Director [[George Marshall (director)|George Marshall]], Marlene Dietrich and producer [[Joe Pasternak]] on the set of ''Destry Rides Again'']]
Famed Western writer [[Max Brand]] contributed the novel, ''[[Destry Rides Again (novel)|Destry Rides Again]]'', but the film also owes its origins to Brand's serial &quot;Twelve Peers&quot;, published in a pulp-magazine. In the original work, Harrison (or &quot;Harry&quot;) Destry was not a pacifist. As [[Destry Rides Again (1932 film)|filmed in 1932]], with [[Tom Mix]] in the starring role, the central character differed in that Destry did wear six-guns in that version.

The film was James Stewart's first western (he would not return to the genre until 1950, with ''[[Broken Arrow (1950 film)|Broken Arrow]]'' and ''[[Winchester 73]]''). The story featured a ferocious cat-fight between Marlene Dietrich and Una Merkel, which apparently caused a mild censorship problem at the time of release.&lt;ref&gt;Quirk 2000, pp. 117–118.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to writer/director [[Peter Bogdanovich]], Marlene Dietrich told him during an aircraft flight that she and James Stewart had an affair during shooting and that she became pregnant and had the baby surreptitiously aborted without telling Stewart.&lt;ref&gt;Riva 1994, pp. 456, 500.&lt;/ref&gt;

Internationally, the film was released under the alternate titles ''[[:fr:Femme ou Démon|Femme ou Démon]]'' in [[French language|French]] and ''Arizona'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

==Reception==
''Destry Rides Again'' was generally well accepted by the public, as well as critics. It was reviewed by Frank S. Nugent in ''[[The New York Times]],'' who noted that the film did not follow the usual Hollywood type-casting. On Dietrich's role, he characterized, &quot;It's difficult to reconcile Miss Dietrich's Frenchy, the cabaret girl of the Bloody Gulch Saloon, with the posed and posturing Dietrich we last saw in Mr. Lubitsch's 'Angel'.&quot; Stewart's contribution was similarly treated, &quot;turning in an easy, likable, pleasantly humored performance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Nugent, Frank S. [http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B03E3DA113AE532A25753C3A9679D946894D6CF &quot; 'Destry Rides Again' (1939).&quot;] ''The New York Times'', originally published November 30, 1939. Retrieved: December 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other versions==
*[[Universal Pictures]] released an earlier version, also titled ''[[Destry Rides Again (1932 film)|Destry Rides Again]]'' (1932), directed by [[Benjamin Stoloff]] and starring [[Tom Mix]] and [[Zasu Pitts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0022810/ Overview:'Destry Rides Again' (1932).&quot;] ''IMDb''.

Produced by [[David Merrick]], the show had a book by [[Leonard Gershe]], music and lyrics by [[Harold Rome]], and starred [[Andy Griffith]] as Destry and [[Dolores Gray]] as Frenchy.
* [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] aired a short-lived television series in 1964, ''[[Destry (TV series)|Destry]]'', based on the first two films, starring [[John Gavin]] as the son of the movie's title character.

{{Ancient Roman religion}}
In [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]], '''Dius Fidius''' (less often as '''Dius Fidus''') was a [[List of Roman deities|god]] of [[oath]]s associated with [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]]. His name was thought to be related to [[Fides (goddess)|Fides]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sextus Pompeius Festus]] s. v. medius&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fidius'' may be an earlier form for ''filius'', &quot;son&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/1258.html William Smith, Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, v. 2, page 150, under Fidius] {{wayback|url=http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/1258.html |date=20110514064436 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the name Dius Fidius originally referring to [[Hercules]] as a son of Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Fasti]]'', 6. 213&lt;/ref&gt; According to some writers,&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], Letters to friends, 5. 21; [[Pliny the Younger|Pliny]], Letters, 4. 3&lt;/ref&gt; the phrase ''medius fidius'' was equivalent to ''mehercule'' &quot;My Hercules!&quot;, a common [[interjection]].

==Theology==
Varro states that his teacher [[Aelius Stilo]] called this god ''Diovis filium'',  i.e. ''Dius Filius'' as the Greek ''Διόσκορον Castorem'' on the grounds of the alteration of the letters ''d'' and ''l'' in the [[Sabine]] tongue. He identified him in Sabine, [[Sancus]] and in Greek, Hercules.&lt;ref&gt;Varro LL V 66; Yves Lehmann &quot;La dette de Varron  à l' égard de son mâitre Aelius Stilo&quot; in '''MEFRA'''  '''97''' 1985  1 p. 519-520.&lt;/ref&gt; This assumption is not linguistically correct, because in the [[Iguvine Tables]] the god  is named ''Fis(i)us'' or ''Fisovius Sancius''. However, his intrepretation, based on unknown theological documents, tallies with that of some modern scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Roger D. Woodard  cited in note below; G. Freyburger  ''Fides'' Dissertation  Strassbourg 1983  p. 476 f.&lt;/ref&gt; The god is certainly not a mere aspect of Jupiter but a separate entity, known in Rome as Semo [[Sancus]] Dius Fidius. Wissowa argues that Jupiter and Dius Fidius divide responsibility for ensuring good faith. The most important oaths are sworn by Jupiter, the god of the ''Fides Publica Populi Romani'' as ''Iuppiter Lapis''. Dius Fidius protects good faith in private affairs: he corresponds to Ζευς Πίστιος.&lt;ref&gt;Wissowa above p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; This view may well reflect a later development but is not the original interpretation. Dius Fidius was not confined to private ''fides'' in early times. Matters of public relevance (such as the first international treaty of Rome, the one with [[Gabii]]) were preserved in his shrine (put under his jurisdiction). 

The shrine of Sancus had no roof, as it was deemed inappropriate and ineffective to swear oaths unless under the sky. The Capitoline temple also had an opening in its roof.

The association of Dius Fidius with Jupiter is divine filiation.&lt;ref&gt;Roger D. Woodard ''Vedic and Indo-European Sacred Space'' Chicago  Illinois Un. Press 2005 p. 189. The scholar thinks  Dius Fidius is the Roman equivalent of Trita Apya, the companion of Indra in the slaying of Vrtra.&lt;/ref&gt; Dumézil underlines the peculiar intertwining and mixing of Jupiter and Dius Fidius as wardens of oaths and wielders of lightning bolts. Both require an opening in the roof of their temples while leaving unanswered for Dumézil the question of the true identity of the latter.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ARR above p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; 

This functional overlap generated confusion about the identity of Sancus Dius Fidius among ancient and modern scholars, as Dius Fidius has sometimes been considered another [[theonym]] for Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumezil ''La religion Roamaine archaïque'' Paris, 1974; It. tr. Milan 1977  p.189.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the autonomy of Semo Sancus from Jupiter and the fact that Dius Fidius is an alternate theonym designating Semo Sancus (and not Jupiter) is shown by the name of the correspondent Umbrian god Fisus Sancius which compounds the two constituent parts of Sancus and Dius Fidius: in Umbrian and Sabine ''Fisus'' is the exact correspondent of ''Fidius'',  as e.g. Sabine ''Clausus'' of Latin ''Claudius''.&lt;ref&gt;Irene Rosenzweig London, 1937,  p. ; D. Briquel &quot;Les aspects militairs du dieu ombrien Fisus Sancius&quot; in '''MEFRA''' 1979 p. 13; E. Norden ''Aus Alrōmischer Priesterbüchen'' Lund 1939 p.  .&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that Sancus as Jupiter is in charge of the observance of oaths, of the laws of hospitality and of loyalty (''Fides'') connects him with the sphere and values of sovereignty, i.e. in Dumézil's terminology, of the first function.  

Wissowa advanced the hypothesis that Semo Sancus is the [[genius]] of Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;G. Wissowa in ''Roschers Lexicon'' 1909 s.v. Semo Sancus col. 3654; ''Religion und Kultus der Römer'' Munich, 1912, p. 131 f.&lt;/ref&gt; W. W. Fowler cautioned that this interpretation looks to be an anachronism and Sancus is a ''Genius Iovius'', as it appears from the Iguvine Tables.&lt;ref&gt;W. W. Fowler ''The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic'' London, 1899, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of a ''genius'' of a deity is attested only in the imperial period.

[[Theodor Mommsen]], [[William Warde Fowler]] and [[Georges Dumezil]] among others rejected the tradition that ascribes a Sabine origin to the Roman cult of Semo Sancus Dius Fidius, partly on linguistic grounds as the theonym is Latin and no mention or evidence of a Sabine ''Semo'' is found near Rome, while the ''Semones'' are attested in Latin in the [[carmen Arvale]]. In their view Sancus would be a deity who was shared by all ancient Italic peoples, whether Osco-Umbrian or Latino-Faliscan.&lt;ref&gt;''La religion romaine archaique'' It. tr. Milano, 1977, p. 80 n. 25, citing also G. Wissowa in ''Roschers Lexicon'' s.v. Sancus, IV, 1909, col. 3168; Dumezil wholly rejects the tradition of the synecism of Rome.&lt;/ref&gt;

The details of the cult of Fisus Sancius at Iguvium and those of Fides at Rome,&lt;ref&gt;cf.Livy I 21, 4; Servius ''Aen.'' I 292 on this prescription of Numa's&lt;/ref&gt;  such as the use of the ''mandraculum'', a piece of linen fabric covering the right hand of the officiant, and of the ''urfeta'' (''orbita'') or of the  ''orbes  ahenei'', sort of small bronze disc brought in the right hand by the officiant at Iguvium and also deposed in the temple of Semo Sancus in 329 B.C. after an affair of treason&lt;ref&gt;Livy  VIII 20, 8; W. W. Fowler ''The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic'' London 1899 p. 138; Irene Rosenzweig ''Ritual and Cult in Pre-Roman Iguvium'' London, 1937, p.210; D. Briquel &quot;Sur les aspects militaires du dieu ombrien Fisus Sancius&quot; in '''MEFRA''' 1979 p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; confirm the parallelism.

Some aspects of Dius Fidius' oath ritual, such as requiring the open sky, the ''compluvium'' of private residences and the fact the temple of Sancus had no roof, implied to romanist O. Sacchi the idea that Dius Fidius' oath predated that for ''Iuppiter Lapis'' or ''Iuppiter Feretrius'', and had its origin in prehistoric rituals, when the ''templum'' was in the open air and defined by natural landmarks such as the highest nearby tree.&lt;ref&gt;O. Sacchi &quot;Il trivaso del Quirinale&quot; in ''Revue Internationale de Droit de l'Antiquité '' 2001 pp. 309-311, citing  Nonius Marcellus s.v. rituis (L p.494): ''Itaque domi rituis nostri, qui per dium Fidium iurare vult, prodire solet in compluvium.'', 'thus according to our rites he who wishes to swear an oath by Dius Fidius he as a rule walks to the ''compluvium'' (an unroofed space within the house)'; Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' III 11, 5 on the use of the private ''mensa'' as an altar mentioned in the ''ius Papirianum''; Granius Flaccus ''indigitamenta'' 8 (H. 109) on king Numa's vow by which he asked for the divine punishment of  perjury by all the gods.&lt;/ref&gt; Supporting this interpretation is the explanation of the theonym Sancus as meaning ''sky'' in Sabine given by Johannes Lydus, etymology that however is rejected by Dumézil, Briquel and others.&lt;ref&gt;Lydus ''de Mensibus'' IV 90; G. Capdeville &quot;Les dieux de Martianus Capella&quot; in ''Revue de l'histoire des religions'' '''213''' 1996  3  p.290.&lt;/ref&gt; 

All the known details concerning Sancus connect him to the sphere of oaths, respect of compacts and the divine guarantee against their breach. These values are all proper to sovereign gods and in common with Jupiter (and with [[Mitra]] in [[Vedic mythology|Vedic religion]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[Roman mythology]], the goddess '''Domiduca''' protects children on the way back to their parents' home. Her male counterpart was '''Domitius''', '''Domidius''' or '''Domiducus''', from ''[[domus]]'', &quot;house,&quot; and ''eo, ire, itum'', &quot;to go.&quot;

Domiduca and Domiducus were also marriage gods who accompanied the bridal procession as the couple arrived at their new home together on the wedding night. The names occur as epithets of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mythindex.com/roman-mythology/D/Domiduca.html&lt;/ref&gt; When the bride has been led home, &quot;the god ''Domitius'' is employed to install her in her house.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;St Augustine (trans.

The '''American Popular Revolutionary Alliance - Peruvian Aprista Party''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Alianza Popular Revolucionaria Americana - Partido Aprista Peruano'') ({{audio|es_alianza-popular-revolucionaria-americana_001.ogg|listen}}) is a [[centre-left]] [[Peru]]vian [[political party]].

At the [[legislative]] [[Peruvian national election, 2006|elections]] held on  9 April 2006, the party won 22.6% of the popular vote and 36 out of 120 seats in the [[Congress of Peru|Congress of the Republic]]. Its presidential candidate at the elections of the same day, [[Alan García]], won 22.6% of the vote and went on to win the second round on 4 June 2006 with 52.6%.

==History==
APRA was originally founded by [[Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre]] in [[Mexico City]] on 7 May 1924 with aspirations to becoming a continent-wide party, and it subsequently influenced a number of other [[Latin America]]n political movements, including [[Bolivia]]'s [[Revolutionary Nationalist Movement]] (''Movimiento Nacionalista Revolucionario'', MNR) and [[Costa Rica]]'s [[National Liberation Party (Costa Rica)|National Liberation Party]] (''Partido Liberación Nacional'', PLN).

It is the oldest surviving political party in Peru and one of the best established.  APRA is as much a social phenomenon as a political movement, with a membership whose loyalty to the party has been unwavering for several generations.

APRA initially espoused anti-imperialism, Pan-Americanism, international solidarity and economic nationalism. Years of repression and clandestinity, as well as Haya de la Torre's single-handed dominance of the party, resulted in striking sectarian and hierarchical traits.&lt;ref&gt;Roett, Riordan. &quot;Peru: The Message from Garcia.&quot; Foreign Affairs 64.2 (1985-1986): 274-286.&lt;/ref&gt; The party's structure and the party's hold over its rank and file proved more lasting than its original program.

Opportunistic ideological swings to the right by Haya de la Torre in the 1950s, in exchange for attaining legal status for the party, resulted in an exodus of some of APRA's most talented{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} young leaders to the Marxist left.

===Political activity since 1980===
After several years of military rule, APRA was allowed to participate as a legal political party in 1979. The party gathered strong support from the electorate, managing to win a majority of seats in the newly created Constitutional Assembly, and supervised the first democratic elections in 12 years.

Haya de la Torre was elected president of the Constituent Assembly and was slated to run as the party's presidential candidate in 1980.  However, he died before the election.  The party was divided between [[Armando Villanueva]] and Andres Townsend, each one of them claiming to be the political and ideological heirs of Haya de la Torre. APRA chose Villanueva as its candidate, while Townsend and other members left the party to create the Movimiento de Bases Hayistas.  The split among the Apristas allowed former president [[Fernando Belaúnde Terry]] of [[Popular Action (Peru)|Acción Popular]] to win the election.

However, APRA managed to win in virtual control of both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. It was also during these election that [[Alan García]] started his political career, after being elected Deputy for the Province of Lima.

The youthful and charismatic García was elected president on April 14, 1985 with 45% of the vote during the first round. Since he did not receive the 50% of the vote required to win the presidency, García was required to enter the second round against [[Alfonso Barrantes Lingán]] (the leftist mayor of [[Lima]]) of the [[United Left (Peru)|Izquierda Unida]] Coalition.  Barrantes, however, decided not to enter the second round of the elections, saying he did not want to prolong the political uncertainty of the country.

García was thus declared president on June 1 and officially took power on July 28, 1985. It was the first time in its sixty-year history that the populist APRA party had come to power in Peru.

His presidency was marked by [[hyperinflation]] with the annual rate exceeding 7,500 percent by the end of the period.

In May 1989, APRA chose as its standard bearer [[Luis Alva Castro]], a long-time rival to García.
Despite APRA's less-than-successful time in power, it managed to obtain 19.6 percent of the vote in the first round of the 1990 elections, more than any of the other parties.

For the final runoff, it is thought that APRA may have cut a deal with ''[[Cambio 90]]'', [[Alberto Fujimori]], to prevent the leading candidate [[Mario Vargas Llosa]] from getting elected. In any case, Fujimori was subsequently elected.

At García's farewell speech, he was booed by the entire opposition forces and prevented from speaking. That same day the board of the Chamber of Deputies requested the creation of a special committee to investigate García's Presidency, accusing him of corruption and illicit enrichment. The committee was presided by [[Fernando Olivera]], who attacked García with various accusations involving embezzlement and corruption. Finally, the Supreme Court declared null all the informs and constitutional accusations against García, who at the time was serving as a Senator for Life. He returned to the Senate on 20 March 1992.

As Fujimori assumed the Presidency, Congress was dominated by the opposition forces of [[Mario Vargas Llosa]]'s [[Democratic Front (Peru)|Democratic Front]]. Fujimori's party had gained only 32 deputies out of 180, and 14 senators out of 60. The majority was divided between APRA and the Democratic Front, each with a 30% of Congress. The two movements were opposed to Fujimori's economic policies, and vetoed most of his laws. They even prepared a special in-door congress election to declare the vacancy of the Presidency.

Fujimori convened elections for a Democratic Constituent Congress, in which APRA did not participate. In 1995, [[Peruvian general election, 1995|general elections]] were held, and the APRA nominee for President was [[Mercedes Cabanillas]], gaining only 4%, behind former [[United Nations Secretary General]] [[Javier Pérez de Cuéllar]] (21%) and the reelected Fujimori (64%). The party only got 7 congressman out of 120, while Fujimori dominated Congress with 68.

In 2000, [[Abel Salinas]] was elected as the presidential nominee, being the worst general election for APRA, gaining 1%. Only 6 APRA congressman were elected. As many assume the election was a fraud, Fujimori resigned after the corruption of his government was revealed by the opposition.

At the [[Peruvian general election, 2001|elections]], the party won 19.7% of the popular vote and 28 out of 120 seats in [[Congress of Peru|Congress]]. Its presidential candidate at the elections of the same day, [[Alan García Pérez]], won 25.8% of the vote and was defeated in the second round by [[Alejandro Toledo]].

In February 2005, García officially commenced his campaign for the [[Peruvian national election, 2006|2006 presidential election]]. He came in second place by a slim margin over [[Lourdes Flores]], and faced [[Ollanta Humala]] in a run-off election on June 4. He became president again as Humala conceded after exit polls and partial vote counts showed García leading. [http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/49A76531-B028-4524-A697-9270F81738A8.htm]. He officially took power on July 28, 2006.

APRA is a member of the [[Socialist International]].

The youth organization of APRA is known as [[Juventud Aprista Peruana]].

[[Hilda Gadea]] - the first female Secretary of the Economy of the Executive National Committee for APRA; later married [[Che Guevara]] and wrote a memoir.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://us.macmillan.com/mylifewithche My Life With Che].&quot; ''[[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan]]''.

Her mother, Catrine (née Gallo), is Italian American (from [[Sicily]]). Lauper's siblings are younger brother Fred (nicknamed Butch), and older sister, Ellen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1285/is_8_31/ai_77336634|title=Cyndi Lauper – and Lou Reed.}}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lauper's parents divorced when she was five.&lt;ref name=biocom&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/cyndi-lauper-17169536 |title=Cyndi Lauper Biography |publisher=Biography.com |accessdate=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother remarried and divorced again.&lt;ref name=&quot;cyndilaupersite.com&quot;&gt;Cyndi Lauper Bio, http://www.cyndilaupersite.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Lauper expressed herself with a variety of hair colors, eccentric clothing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| work=On the Media| first=Brooke| last=Gladstone |title=Interview With Cyndi Lauper}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even took a friend's advice to spell her name as &quot;Cyndi&quot; rather than &quot;Cindy&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;WETV&quot;/&gt;

She eventually traveled to [[Vermont]], where she took art classes at [[Johnson State College]] and supported herself working odd jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

In the early 1970s, Lauper performed as a vocalist with various [[cover band]]s. One, called Flyer, was active in the New York metropolitan area, singing hits by bands including [[Bad Company]], [[Jefferson Airplane]] and [[Led Zeppelin]]. Although Lauper was performing on stage, she was not happy singing [[cover version|cover]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, Lauper damaged her vocal cords and took a year off from singing. She was told by doctors that she would never sing again, but regained her voice with the help of vocal coach Katie Agresta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyndilaupersite.com/biography/ |title=Biography &amp;#124; Cyndi Lauper – Photos, Videos, Music, Biography |publisher=Cyndilaupersite.com |date= |accessdate=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980–1982: ''Blue Angel''===
{{Main article|Blue Angel (band)|l1=Blue Angel}}
In 1978, Lauper met saxophone player [[John Turi]] through her manager Ted Rosenblatt. Turi and Lauper formed a band named ''Blue Angel'' and recorded a demo tape of original music. [[Steven Massarsky|Steve Massarsky]], manager of [[The Allman Brothers Band]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anderson|first1=Porter|title=Steve Massarsky: Starting small with BIG|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2000/CAREER/jobenvy/09/29/steve.massarsky/|website=cnn.com|publisher=Cable News Network|accessdate=September 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; heard the tape and liked Lauper's voice. He bought Blue Angel's contract for $5,000 and became their manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lauper received recording offers as a solo artist, but held out, wanting the band to be included in any deal she made. Blue Angel was eventually signed by [[Polydor Records]] and released a self-titled album on the label in 1980. Lauper hated the album cover, saying that it made her look like [[Big Bird]], but ''Rolling Stone'' magazine later included it as one of the 100 best [[New wave music|new wave]] album covers (2003). Despite critical acclaim, the album sold poorly (or &quot;It went lead&quot;, as Lauper later joked.) and the band broke up. The members of Blue Angel had a falling-out with Massarsky and fired him as their manager. He later filed an $80,000 suit against them, which forced Lauper into bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/lauper_cyndi/artist.jhtml|title=Cyndi Lauper|publisher=MTV|accessdate=March 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this Lauper temporarily lost her voice due to an inverted cyst in her vocal cord.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=David|last=Chiu |url=http://time.com/65952/cyndi-lauper-shes-so-unusual/ |title=Cyndi Lauper's She's So Unusual Is 30: New Tour With Cher, Kinky Boots |work=TIME |date= |accessdate=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Blue Angel broke up and, due to her financial problems, Lauper spent time working in retail stores, waitressing at [[IHOP]] (which she quit after being demoted to hostess when the manager made a pass at her),&lt;ref name=&quot;WETV&quot;/&gt; and singing in local clubs. Her most frequent gigs were at El Sombrero.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; Music critics who saw Lauper perform with Blue Angel believed she had star potential due to her four-octave singing range,&lt;ref&gt;Jerome, Jim.

===1983–1985: ''She's So Unusual''===
{{Main article|She's So Unusual}}
On October 14, 1983, Lauper released her first solo album, ''[[She's So Unusual]]''. The album peaked at No.&amp;nbsp;4 in the US, and became a worldwide hit. The primary studio musicians were [[Eric Bazilian]] and [[Rob Hyman]] (of [[The Hooters]]), [[Rick Chertoff]], [[Richard Termini]] and Peter Wood. Lauper became popular with teenagers and critics, in part due to her hybrid punk image, which was crafted by stylist Patrick Lucas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://articles.latimes.com/1985-02-08/news/vw-4846_1_freckles-show |title=Capturing Head-to-Toe Look of the '80s |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=February 8, 1985 |accessdate=October 15, 2011 |first=Mary |last=Rourke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{listen |pos=left|filename=Cyndi Lauper - Girls Just Want To Have Fun.ogg|title=&quot;Girls Just Want To Have Fun&quot;.|Type=single}}
Lauper was interested in writing her own songs, but the record company provided her with songs to record that were written by other writers. Lauper sometimes changed the lyrics in the material she was given by the record company; such is the case with &quot;[[Girls Just Want to Have Fun]]&quot;. Lauper found the original lyrics to be misogynistic, so she rewrote the song as an anthem for young women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Priya |last=Elan |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/sep/27/popandrock |title=Music: Priya Elan pays tribute to the man who wrote Girls Just Want To Have Fun |newspaper=The Guardian |date=September 27, 2008 |accessdate=October 15, 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The album's second single &quot;[[Time After Time (Cyndi Lauper song)|Time After Time]]&quot; was co-written by Lauper and Rob Hyman. &quot;Time After Time&quot; hit No.&amp;nbsp;1 on both the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and Adult Contemporary charts. The song would earn Lauper an [[Gold record|RIAA Gold certification]] for record sales that reached 500,000 copies.

The other [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] singles on ''She's So Unusual'' were &quot;[[She Bop]]&quot; (No.&amp;nbsp;3), &quot;[[All Through the Night (Cyndi Lauper song)|All Through the Night]]&quot; (No.&amp;nbsp;5), written by [[Jules Shear]], and &quot;[[Money Changes Everything]]&quot; (No.27).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.billboard.com, chart history, September 8, 1984, December 8, 1984, February 9, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

The album includes two cover songs, [[The Brains]]' new wave track &quot;[[Money Changes Everything]]&quot; (No. 27 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100) and [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s &quot;[[When You Were Mine (Prince song)|When You Were Mine]]&quot;. The album made Lauper the first female to have four consecutive ''Billboard'' Hot 100 top five hits from one album. The LP stayed in the Top 200 charts for more than 65 weeks, and since has sold 22 million copies worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;SSU Sales&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Nick|last=Duerden |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/cyndi-lauper-interview-shes-still-having-fun-9235643.html |title=Cyndi Lauper interview: She's still having fun – Features – Music |newspaper=The Independent |date=April 4, 2014 |accessdate=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fourth single from the album, &quot;[[Boy Blue (Cyndi Lauper song)|Boy Blue]]&quot;, did not reach the top-40. She donated the proceeds of that song to [[AIDS]] research. The song &quot;True Colors&quot; (written by Steinberg and Kelly) was licensed to [[Kodak]] for use in its commercials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = True Colors by Cyndi Lauper Songfacts|url = http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=3101 |website = www.songfacts.com |access-date = 2016-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lauper played a psychic in search of a city of gold in South America. [[Ron Howard]] produced the film, with David Wolff as associate producer. To prepare for the role, Lauper took a few classes in [[finger wave|finger waving]] and hair setting at the Robert Fiance School of Beauty in New York, and studied with a few Manhattan psychics. The film flopped and was poorly received by critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.filmbug.com/db/1180 |title=Cyndi Lauper – Filmbug |website=www.filmbug.com |access-date=2016-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://lyrics.songonlyrics.net/cyndi-lauper-biography |title=Cyndi Lauper Biography |website=Song Lyrics – Music Lyrics – Newest Lyrics With Video |access-date=2016-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song &quot;[[Ballad of Cleo and Joe]]&quot; addressed the complications of a [[drag queen]]'s double life. The song &quot;Say a Prayer&quot; was written for a friend of hers who had died from AIDS. &quot;Unhook the Stars&quot; was used in the [[Unhook the Stars|movie of the same name]].

==Activism==
[[File:Cyndi Lauper at Gay Games VII.jpg|thumb|200px|Lauper performing at the Gay Games VII, Wrigley Field, July 22, 2006]]
Lauper has been an LGBT rights supporter throughout her career, campaigning for equality through various charities and [[gay pride]] events around the world. Lauper stated that she became involved in gay rights advocacy because her sister Ellen is a lesbian and because Lauper herself was passionate about equality. Lauper cites her sister Ellen as a role model.&lt;ref name=voice&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thegavoice.com/cyndi-laupers-true-colors/|title=Cyndi Lauper’s ‘True Colors’|publisher=GA Voice|accessdate=January 23, 2016|date=July 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her song &quot;Above the Clouds&quot; celebrates the memory of [[Matthew Shepard]], a young man beaten to death in Wyoming because he was gay. As a member of the [[Matthew Shepard Foundation]] Board, Lauper devoted a [[concert tour]] in 2005 to promoting the Foundation's message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advocate.com/arts-entertainment/entertainment-news/2005/12/14/cyndi-lauper-joins-honorary-board-matthew-shepard|title=Cyndi Lauper joins honorary board of Matthew Shepard Foundation|publisher=The Advocate|accessdate=January 23, 2016|date=December 14, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She co-founded the [[True Colors World Tour]] for Human Rights throughout the United States and Canada in June 2007. One dollar from each ticket was earmarked for the [[Human Rights Campaign]], which advocates equal rights for LGBT individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory?id=2943293 |title=Lauper, Others Headline Gay Rights Tour |publisher=ABC News |date= |accessdate=October 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2010, Lauper's True Colors Fund launched the Give a Damn campaign, to help get straight people more involved in LGBT rights.&lt;ref name=voice/&gt;

In 2012 Lauper started the ''Forty to None Project'' after learning that while 10% of American youth identify themselves as LGBT, up to 40% of American homeless youths do so. She set up the ''True Colors Residence'' in New York City for LGBT homeless youths. The 30-bed facility offers temporary shelter and job placement help.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/cyndi-lauper-opens-shelter-for-homeless-lgbt-youth-20110825|title=Cyndi Lauper Opens Shelter for Homeless LGBT Youth |publisher=rollingstone.com |date=August 25, 2011 |accessdate=August 28, 2015 |first=Inae |last=Oh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her iconic cover and re-arrangement of &quot;[[Girls Just Wanna Have Fun]]&quot; established her as 'a feminist idol'.&lt;ref name=&quot;thebiographychannel.co.uk&quot;/&gt; Sheila Moeschen argued that the song 'embodied a different kind of feminine aesthetic that ran counter to the raw sensuality and edginess of her contemporaries like Madonna or veteran rockers Joan Jett and Pat Benatar' that introduced 'a nation of women to a new kind of female role model, one that celebrated difference and encouraged playfulness in self-expression'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sheila-moeschen/girls-still-just-wanna-have-fun_b_3061316.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Sheila | last=Moeschen | title=Girls Still Just Wanna Have Fun: At 30, Cyndi Lauper's Feminist Anthem Endures | date=April 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Rockwell]] wrote that the song was &quot;a giddily upbeat attestation to female pleasure that simultaneously made a feminist statement, fulfilled male fantasies and—especially in its often-played video version—evoked the warmth of family and friends.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;theatlantic.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Green |first=Emma |url=http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/04/the-feisty-feminism-of-girls-just-want-to-have-fun-30-years-later/359834/ |title=The Feisty Feminism of 'Girls Just Want to Have Fun,' 30 Years Later – Emma Green |work=The Atlantic |date=April 1, 2014 |accessdate=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video for &quot;Girls&quot; won the first-ever Best Female Video prize at the 1984 VMAs.

Her song &quot;True Colors&quot; is recognized by many as an LGBT anthem.

Lagos initially emerged as a [[port city]] which originated on a collection of islands, which are contained in the present day Local Government Areas ([[List of Lagos State local government areas by population|LGAs]]) of [[Lagos Island]], [[Eti-Osa]], [[Amuwo-Odofin]] and [[Apapa]]; the islands are separated by [[Estuary|creeks]], fringing the southwest mouth of [[Lagos Lagoon]], while protected from the Atlantic Ocean by [[barrier island]]s and long [[sand spit]]s such as [[Bar Beach, Lagos|Bar Beach]], which stretch up to {{convert|100|km|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} east and west of the mouth. Due to rapid urbanization, the city expanded to the west of the lagoon to include areas in the present day [[Lagos Mainland]], [[Ajeromi-Ifelodun]] and [[Surulere]]. This led to the classification of Lagos into two main areas - the [[Lagos#Island|Island]], which was the initial city of Lagos, before it expanded into the area known as the [[Lagos#Mainland|Mainland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lagos Case Study&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://water.tkk.fi/wr/tutkimus/glob/publications/Haapala/pdf-files/CASE%20STUDY%20OF%20LAGOS.pdf | title=CASE STUDY OF LAGOS | accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This city area was governed directly by the Federal Government through the ''Lagos City Council'', until the creation of [[Lagos State]] in 1967, which led to the splitting of Lagos city into the present day seven [[List of Lagos State local government areas by population|Local Government Areas]] (LGAs), and an addition of other towns (which now make up 13 LGAs) from the then [[Western Region, Nigeria|Western Region]], to form the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lagos State Information&quot;/&gt;

Lagos which was the capital of Nigeria since its amalgamation in 1914, went on to become the capital of [[Lagos State]], after its creation. However, the state capital was later moved to [[Ikeja]] in 1976, while the federal capital also moved to [[Abuja]] in 1991.

''Lagos'', which means &quot;lakes&quot;, was a name given to the settlement by the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]]. The present-day Lagos state has a high percentage of Awori, who migrated to the area from Isheri along the [[Ogun river]]. Throughout history, it was home to a number of warring ethnic groups who had settled in the area. Following its early settlement by the Awori nobility, and its conquest by the Bini warlords of Benin, the state first came to the attention of the Portuguese in the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edo-nation.net/eko.htm |title=The Origin of Eko (Lagos) |publisher=Edo Nation |accessdate=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Portuguese explorer Rui de Sequeira visited the area in 1472, naming the area around the city ''Lago de Curamo''. Another explanation is that Lagos was named for [[Lagos, Portugal]]—a maritime town which, at the time, was the main centre of Portuguese expeditions down the African coast.

In Britain's early 19th century fight against the [[transatlantic slave trade]], its [[West Africa Squadron]] or Preventative Squadron as it was also known, continued to pursue Portuguese, American, French, and Cuban slave ships and to impose anti-slavery treaties with West African coastal chiefs with so much doggedness that they created a strong presence along the West African coast from Sierra Leone all the way to the Niger Delta (today's Nigeria) and as far south as Congo.&lt;ref name=Smith-1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Robert|title=The Lagos Consulate 1851-1861|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9780520037465|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1849, Britain appointed [[John Beecroft]] Consul of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, a position he held (along with his governorship of Fernando Po) until his death in 1854.&lt;ref name=&quot;DNB&quot;&gt;Howard Temperley, ‘Beecroft, John (1790–1854)’, rev.

Oba Akitoye then signed the [[Treaty Between Great Britain and Lagos, 1 January 1852|Treaty between Great Britain and Lagos abolishing slavery]].

Dosunmu resisted the terms of the treaty but under the threat to unleash violence on Lagos by Commander Bedingfield, Dosunmu relented and signed the [[Lagos Treaty of Cession]] on August 6, 1861.&lt;ref name = british/&gt;&lt;ref name=Elebute&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elebute|first1=Adeyemo|title=The Life of James Pinson Labulo Davies: A Colossus of Victorian Lagos|publisher=Kachifo Limited/Prestige|isbn=9789785205763|pages=143–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0IwMwBVfr0sC&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=|title=Africa's Urban Past|author1=David Anderson|author2=Richard Rathbone|publisher=James Currey Publishers, 2000|isbn=978-0-852-5576-17|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The remainder of modern-day Nigeria was seized in 1887, and when the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria was established in 1914, Lagos was declared its capital, continuing as such after the country's independence from Britain in 1960. Along with migrants from all over Nigeria and other West African nations were the returnee ex-slaves known as Creoles, who came from [[Freetown]], [[Sierra Leone]], Brazil and the [[West Indies]] to Lagos. The Creoles contributed to Lagos' modernisation and their knowledge of [[Portuguese architecture]] can still be seen from the architecture on Lagos Island. Electric street lighting was introduced in the city in 1898.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williamsguide&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url =http://books.openedition.org/ifra/829?nomobile=1|title=INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT AND URBAN FACILITIES IN LAGOS, 1861-2000|author=Ayodeji Olukoju|publisher=Institut français de recherche en Afrique (IFRA-Nigeria)|pages=22–45|website = OpenEdition Books|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lagos experienced rapid growth throughout the 1960s and 1970s as a result of Nigeria's economic boom.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conference&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pamro.org/pamro/2008/PAMRO%20LOC%20Welcome%2014Aug08.PPT|title=2008 All Africa Media Research Conference|page=8 |publisher=Pan African Media Research Organisation |accessdate=4 April 2012|format=PPT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the creation of [[Lagos State]] on 27 May 1967, Lagos, which was the country's capital had been administered directly by the Federal Government as a Federal Territory through the ''Federal Ministry of Lagos Affairs'', while the Lagos City Council (LCC) governed the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lagos State Information&quot;/&gt; Lagos, along with the towns from the then Western region ([[Ikeja]], [[Agege]], [[Mushin, Lagos|Mushin]], [[Ikorodu]], [[Epe, Lagos State|Epe]] and [[Badagry]]), were eventually captured to create Lagos State.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lagos State Information&quot;/&gt; Lagos city was split into the present day seven [[List of Lagos State local government areas by population|Local Government Areas]] (LGAs), while the other towns now make up 13 LGAs in the state. Lagos played the dual role of being the State and Federal Capital until 1976, when the state capital was moved to Ikeja. Lagos was adversely affected during Nigeria's military rule.&lt;ref name=first&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2015/01/lagos/draper-text|title=Lagos Nigeria: Africa's First city|author1=Robert Draper|author2=Robin Hammond|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=April 18, 2016|date=January 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, on 12 December 1991, the seat of the Federal Government was also formally relocated to [[Abuja]]. However, Lagos still remains the financial centre of the country, and also grew to become the most populous conurbation in the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lagos State Information&quot;/&gt;

== Geography ==
[[File:Lagos Island.jpg|thumb|300px|Skyline of Lagos]]
Lagos is loosely classified into two main geographical areas - the &quot;Island&quot; and the &quot;Mainland&quot;.

===Island===
The Island is a loose geographical term that is used to define the area of Lagos which is separated from the &quot;mainland&quot; by the main channel draining the lagoon into the Atlantic Ocean, which forms Lagos Harbour. The Island is mainly a collection of islands that are separated from each other by creeks of varying sizes and are connected together by bridges. The smaller sections of some creeks have been dredged and built over. This part of Lagos is the area where most business activities and entertainment events in Lagos takes place. It also houses most of the upscale residential areas in Lagos. The two major urban islands of Lagos in Lagos Lagoon are [[Lagos Island]] and [[Victoria Island (Nigeria)|Victoria Island]]. Other Local Government areas which are considered to be in the Island include: [[Amuwo-Odofin]], [[Apapa]] (sometimes also regarded as in the mainland) and [[Eti-Osa]]. Three major bridges join the island to the mainland. They are the [[Carter Bridge]] which start from Iddo, the [[Eko Bridge]] (formerly called the Second Mainland Bridge) and the [[Third Mainland Bridge]], which passes through densely populated mainland suburbs to the Lagos Lagoon.

====Lagos Island====
[[File:2010 Lagos Nigeria 5284107494.jpg|250px|thumb|Lagos Marina.]]
{{Main article|Lagos Island}}
Lagos Island contains a [[central business district]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://limge.org/editorials.html|title='The lagos pressure group on the environment''|publisher= Limge Online |accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This district is characterised by high-rise buildings. The island also contains many of the city's largest wholesale marketplaces (such as the popular [[Idumota Market|Idumota]] and [[Balogun Market]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=2008 All Africa Media Research Conference|page=34 |publisher=Nigeria Tribune |date=26 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has the National Museum of Nigeria, the Central Mosque, the Glover Memorial Hall, [[Cathedral Church of Christ, Lagos|Christ's Church Cathedral (CMS)]], and the [[Oba of Lagos|Oba]]'s Palace ([[Iga Idunganran]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetransmittergroup.com/index.php?p=blog&amp;w=a&amp;id=1532|title=Simply Lagos|publisher=The Transmitter|accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another major part of Lagos Island is Marina. It borders around the idumota and Balogun markets and houses major Banking institutions. Though formerly in a derelict condition, Lagos Island's Tinubu Square is a site of historical importance; it was here that the Amalgamation Ceremony that unified the North and South [[protectorate]] to form Nigeria took place in 1914.

====Ikoyi====
{{Main article|Ikoyi}}
[[Ikoyi]] is situated on the eastern half of Lagos Island and joined to it by a landfill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edo-nation.net/eko.htm |title=Journal of the Nigerian Institution of Estate Surveyors and Valuers: ''An empirical study of the Lagos state rent edict of 1997'' |author=Oni, A. O |year=2008 |accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ikoyi is also connected to Victoria Island by Falomo bridge, which carries a main road over Five Cowrie creek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Branch of the Nigerian Institution of estate surveyors &amp; Valuers|publisher=Lagos state |date= 30 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ikoyi housed the headquarters of the federal government of Nigeria and other buildings owned by the government, including the old federal secretariat complex. The complex today is on reestablishment.

In Ikoyi there are military and police barracks, a top-security prison and a federal high court of Nigeria. Ikoyi also has a number of hotels, night clubs, a recreational park and one of Africa's largest golf courses. Originally a [[middle class]] neighbourhood, in recent years, it has become a fashionable residential enclave for the [[upper middle class]] to the [[upper class]]. There are also commercial activities in Ikoyi which is spotted in increasing number of offices, banks and shopping complexes. The commercial section is concentrated in the South-West.

====Victoria Island====
{{Main article|Victoria Island (Nigeria)}}
Victoria Island with its annexe is situated to the south of Lagos Island.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conference&quot;/&gt; It has expensive real estate properties and for that reason, many new luxury condos and apartments are blooming up everywhere.
Along with Ikoyi, Victoria Island occupies a major area in Lagos which boasts of several sizeable shopping districts. On its sea shore along the Atlantic front, there is environmentally reconstructed [[Bar Beach, Lagos|Bar Beach]].

====Iddo====
Across the main channel of the lagoon from Lagos Island, there is a smaller settlement called [[Iddo Island|Iddo]]. Iddo is also [[Lagos Terminus railway station|a railroad terminus]] and it is now situated in the Lagos Mainland local government area after it was connected to the mainland like a peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laurapodolnick.com/lagosny.pdf |title=Giant Cities Of Tiny Islands |publisher=|accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mainland===
A huge population of Lagosians also live on the mainland, and most industries are located there. The mainland is known for its music and night life, which used to be located in areas around [[Yaba, Lagos|Yaba]] and [[Surulere]]. However, in recent years more night clubs have sprung up on the Island, making the Island (particularly Victoria Island) the main nightlife attractions. Mainland LGAs include [[Surulere]], [[Ajeromi-Ifelodun]] and [[Lagos Mainland]]. Metropolitan Lagos suburban LGAs include: [[Agege]], [[Apapa]], [[Mushin, Lagos|Mushin]], [[Oshodi-Isolo]] and [[Ikeja]] (site of [[Murtala Muhammed International Airport]] and the capital of Lagos State).

Major Areas on the mainland include [[Ebute Metta]], [[Yaba, Lagos|Yaba]], Ajah and [[Ejigbo, Lagos|Ejigbo]]. Some rivers, like [[Badagry]] Creek, flow parallel to the coast for some distance before exiting through the sand bars to the sea.

===Climate===
Lagos experiences [[tropical savanna climate]] (''Aw'') according to the [[Köppen climate classification]], as there's a significant precipitation difference between the wet season and the dry season. The wet season starts in April and ends in October, while the dry season starts in November and ends in March. The wettest month is June with precipitation total {{convert|315.5|mm}}, while the driest month is January with precipitation total {{convert|13.2|mm}}.

As the city is located near the equator, the temperature remains constant with no significant difference between the hottest month and the coolest month. The hottest month is March with average temperature {{convert|28.5|C}}, while the coolest month is August with average temperature {{convert|25.0|C}}.

==Administration and demographics==
In terms of administration, Lagos is not a single [[municipality]] and therefore has no overall city administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.unhabitat.org/downloads/docs/9175_77451_Cities_and_CitizensSeries_Addis_casablanca_Lagos.pdf |title=Cities &amp; Citizens Series:''Urban Iniquities in three Cities''|publisher=Unhabit Online |accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The geographical city limits of Metropolitan Lagos comprises 16 of the 20 Local Government Areas, which together comprise Lagos State. The latter entity provides overall government for the metropolitan region. The Municipality of Lagos, which covered Lagos Island, Ikoyi and Victoria Island as well as some mainland territory, was managed by the Lagos City Council (LCC), but it was disbanded in 1976 and divided into several [[Local Government Areas in Nigeria|Local Government Areas]] (most notably Lagos Island LGA, [[Lagos Mainland|Lagos Mainland LGA]] and [[Eti-Osa|Eti-Osa LGA]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Public Admin. Dev. Urban local government finance in Nigeria: ''The case of Lagos municipal area''|page=12: 19–38.| doi= 10.1002/pad.4230120103 |author=Dr. Dele Olowu |year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mainland beyond the Municipality of Lagos, on the other hand, comprised several separate towns and settlements such as [[Mushin, Nigeria|Mushin]], Ikeja and Agege. In the wake of the 1970s Nigerian oil boom, Lagos experienced a population explosion, untamed economic growth, and unmitigated rural migration. This caused the outlying towns and settlements to develop rapidly, thus forming the present day &quot;Lagos Metropolitan Area&quot;, also known as &quot;Metropolitan Lagos&quot;. The history of Lagos is still evidenced in the layout of the LGAs which display the unique identities of the cultures that created them.

By 2006, the metro area around Lagos had extended beyond Lagos State's boundaries and attained a [[megacity]] status. This much larger area is referred to as &quot;Greater Metropolitan Lagos&quot; or &quot;Lagos Megacity Region&quot;, which is a continuous built up land area of additional {{convert|1,535.4|km2|sqmi|lk=out|abbr=off}}, comprising sprawls in LGAs situated next to Lagos' eastern and western city limits in Lagos State, and beyond northern limits, spilling into the LGAs in adjoining [[Ogun State]]. Ogun State LGAs within Greater Metropolitan Lagos majorly include: [[Obafemi Owode]], [[Sagamu]], [[Ifo]], [[Ado-Odo/Ota]] and part of [[Ewekoro]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The sustainable city&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Map of the Local Government Areas of Lagos.png|thumb|550px|A map showing the 16 [[Local Government Areas in Nigeria|LGAs]] making up Lagos Metropolitan Area]]
Today, the word ''Lagos'' most often refers to the urban area, called &quot;Metropolitan Lagos&quot; in Nigeria, which includes both the islands of the former municipality of Lagos and the mainland suburbs. Lagos State government is responsible for some of the utilities including roads and transportation, power, water, health, and education.
Metropolitan Lagos extends over 16 of the 20 LGAs of Lagos State, and contains about 85% of the population of Lagos State, and includes semi-rural areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;METRO&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.africaleadership.org/rc/Managing%20Metropolitan%20Lagos.pdf |title= Managing Metropolitan Lagos |publisher=R.Rasaki |accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lagos City has a considerable number of high-rise buildings which dominate its skyline. Most of the tall buildings are located in the downtown Central Business District.

Lagos was the former capital city of Nigeria but it has since been replaced by [[Abuja]]. Abuja officially gained its status as the capital of Nigeria on 12 December 1991, although the decision to move the federal capital had been made in now Act no. 6 of 1976. Lagos is also home to the High Court of the [[Lagos State Judiciary]], housed in an old colonial building on Lagos Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nigeria-law.org/LagosStateJudiciaryInBrief.htm|title=Lagos State Judiciary|page= |publisher= Nigeria Law Online |accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Census data for Lagos===
Although the 2006 National Population Census of Nigeria credited the metropolitan area with a population figure of 7,937,932, the figure is at variance with some projections by the UN and other population agencies and groups worldwide. The population figure of [[Lagos State]] given by the Lagos State Government is 17,553,924. It was based on conducted enumeration for social planning by the Lagos State Government and it believes that since the inhabitants of the metropolitan area of Lagos constitute 88% of the Lagos State population, the population of metropolitan Lagos is about 15.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nigerianmuse.com/20070207234037zg/important_documents/Lagos_Census_Affairs|title=Document|page=|publisher=Nigerian Muse Online|date=7 February 2007|accessdate=4 April 2012|format=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A rejoinder to Lagos State Government views&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economicconfidential.com/repopulation.htm |title=NATIONAL POPULATION COMMISSION – MISUNDERSTANDING, MISPERCEPTION AND MISREPRESENTATION OF CENSUS 2006 A REJOINDER TO THE PUBLICATION – &quot;The Falsification of Lagos Census Figure&quot; by Lagos State Government |publisher=Economicconfidential.com |accessdate=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that &quot;Lagos State concealed the fact that the population projection, for Lagos Urban Agglomeration by the UN agencies had been revised downwards substantially as early as 2003. It failed to interpret the two most important and fairly representative and reliable secondary data sets already in public domain, the National Identity Card Scheme and the 2003 Voters Registration figures from INEC.

Lagos is, by most estimates, one of the fastest-growing cities in the world.&lt;ref name = africareport/&gt; Lagos is currently experiencing a population increase of about 275,000 persons per annum. In 1999 the [[United Nations]] predicted that the city's metropolitan area, which had only about 290,000 inhabitants in 1950, would exceed 20 million by 2010 and thus become one of the ten most populated cities in the world.

There is a huge spectrum of wealth distribution among the people that reside in Lagos. It ranges from the very wealthy to the very poor.

Cycling is increasingly becoming a sport to be reckoned with. About three years ago, [http://cycology.com.ng/ Cycology Riding Club] started a club in Lagos and soon after, other clubs mushroomed in cities like Port Harcourt and Abuja.

Lagos's importance as a commercial centre and port and its strategic location have led to it being the end-point of three [[Trans-African Highway]] routes using Nigeria's national roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= http://www.afdb.org/fileadmin/uploads/afdb/Documents/Project-and-Operations/00473227-EN-TAH-FINAL-VOL2.PDF |title=African Development Bank/United Nations Economic Commission For Africa: &quot;Review of the Implementation Status of the Trans African Highways and the Missing Links |volume=2 Description of Corridors |publisher=African Development Bank |date=14 August 2003|accessdate=14 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Trans–West African Coastal Highway]] leaves the city as the Badagry Expressway to [[Benin]] and beyond as far as [[Dakar]] and [[Nouakchott]]; the [[Trans-Sahara Highway]] to [[Algiers]], which is close to completion, leaves the city as the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.un.org/ecosocdev/geninfo/afrec/vol20no3/203-highways.htmlT |title=''Africa Renewal''|volume=20| issue =  3|page=14 |publisher=Itai Madamombe : &quot;NEPAD promotes better transport networks&quot; |date=October 2006|accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lagos State has a bus rapid transit (BRT) system;&lt;ref name=&quot;BRT&quot;/&gt; the first phase was completed in February 2008. It is expected to operate along eight routes using specially designated [[bus rapid transit]] lanes running through the city, with the aim of expanding to other routes in the future.
The first phase of the Lagos BRT runs {{convert|12|mi|0|order=flip|abbr=on}} through [[Ikorodu Road]] and [[Funsho Williams]] Avenue up to CMS. After weeks of test runs, operations started on 17 March 2008, six months earlier than planned.&lt;ref name=&quot;BRT&quot;/&gt; also, the signature color of Lagos state 14-seater bus (known as Danfo) is yellow with a touch of black.

It has been estimated that the system will transport about 10,000 passengers in each direction per hour during peak travel times. At these times traffic congestion, called &quot;[[Go-Slow Lagos|Go Slow]]&quot;, by Lagosians, can be extreme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2026474_2026675_2074274,00.html|title=Intelligent Cities:Making Over Lagos|work=Time Lists|date=26 May 2011|last=Perry|first=Alex|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[LAMATA]] [[bus rapid transit]] corridor covers a distance of about {{convert|22|km|0|abbr=on}}. The system is run by two operators, NURTW Cooperative (Nigerian Union of Road Transport Workers) and [[Lagbus]], a Lagos State Government owned Asset Management Company which contributes about 180 high capacity buses for the implementation of the first phase Mile 12 to CMS BRT Lite system.

=== Rail ===
An extensive urban rail system, [[Lagos Rail Mass Transit]], running through the Lagos metropolis is currently under construction.&lt;ref name=africareport/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lamata-ng.com/rail_services.php|title=Lagos Area Metropolitan Transit Authority|last=|first=|date=|website=www.lamata-ng.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lagosrail.com/home/index.php|title=''LAMATA Rail Services''|publisher=Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport Authority|accessdate=4 April 2012|format=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several intercity and commuter trains serve Lagos through the [[Lagos Terminus railway station]].

===Ferries===
[[Lagos State Ferry Services Corporation]] runs a few regular routes, for example between Lagos Island and the mainland, served by modern ferries and wharves. Private boats run irregular passenger services on the lagoon and on some creeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lamata-ng.com/water_transport.html|title=LAMATA Ferry Services|page= |publisher=LAMATA  |accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air===
Lagos is served by [[Murtala Muhammed International Airport]], one of the largest and [[List of the busiest airports in Africa|busiest airports in Africa]] and a top international air passenger gateway to Nigeria. The airport is located in the northern suburb of Ikeja and has Domestic and International Terminals. With 5.1 million passengers in 2008, the airport accounts for almost fifty percent of all air traffic in Nigeria. Murtalla Muhammad International Airport Lagos is known is largest west African airport that serves million of Nigerian Expats from all over the world. The airport is main hub of Medview Airline and Arik Air but other major airlines like British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, KLM, Air France, Lufthansa and Turkish airlines operate daily flights to Lagos from all over the globe. Outbound international travel from Murtala Mohammed Airport accounts for the majority of all air passengers travelling to and from Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Early life==

===Childhood===
[[File:ameliachild.jpg|left|frame|Amelia Earhart as a child]]

Earhart was the daughter of Samuel &quot;Edwin&quot; Stanton Earhart (1867-1930) and Amelia &quot;Amy&quot; (nee [[Otis family|Otis]]) (1869–1962).&lt;ref&gt;[http://oasis.harvard.edu:10080/oasis/deliver/~sch00228 &quot;A/E11/M-129, Earhart, Amy Otis, 1869–1962. Papers, 1944, n.d.: A Finding Aid.&quot;] ''Harvard University Library.'' Retrieved: June 3, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; She was born in [[Atchison, Kansas|Atchison]], Kansas, in the [[Amelia Earhart Birthplace|home of her maternal grandfather]], Alfred Gideon Otis (1827–1912), who was a former [[United States federal judge|federal judge]], the president of the Atchison Savings Bank and a leading citizen in the town. Amelia was the second child of the marriage, after an infant stillborn in August 1896.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldstein and Dillon p. 8&quot;/&gt; She was of part [[German American|German]] descent. Alfred Otis had not initially favored the marriage and was not satisfied with Edwin's progress as a lawyer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldstein and Dillon p. 9&quot;/&gt;

According to family custom, Earhart was named after her two grandmothers, Amelia Josephine Harres and Mary Wells Patton.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldstein and Dillon p. 8&quot;&gt;[[#refGoldsteinandDillon1997|Goldstein and Dillon 1997]], p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; From an early age, Earhart, nicknamed &quot;Meeley&quot; (sometimes &quot;Millie&quot;) was the ringleader while her younger sister (two years her junior), Grace Muriel Earhart (1899–1998), nicknamed &quot;Pidge&quot;, acted the dutiful follower.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ninety-nines.org/grace-muriel-earhart-morrissey.htm &quot;Grace Muriel Earhart Morrissey.&quot;] ''The Ninety-Nines.'' Retrieved: June 3, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Both girls continued to answer to their childhood nicknames well into adulthood.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldstein and Dillon p. 8&quot;/&gt; Their upbringing was unconventional since Amy Earhart did not believe in molding her children into &quot;nice little girls.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refGoldsteinandDillon1997|Goldstein and Dillon 1997]], pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile their maternal grandmother disapproved of the &quot;[[Bloomers (clothing)|bloomers]]&quot; worn by Amy's children and although Earhart liked the freedom they provided, she was aware other girls in the neighborhood did not wear them.

===Early influence===
A spirit of adventure seemed to abide in the Earhart children, with the pair setting off daily to explore their neighborhood.{{refn|Quote: &quot;...the judge nevertheless adored his brave and intelligent granddaughter and in her [Earhart's] love of adventure, she seemed to have inherited his pioneering spirit.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refRandolph1987|Randolph 1987]], p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}} As a child, Earhart spent long hours playing with sister Pidge, climbing trees, hunting rats with a rifle and &quot;belly-slamming&quot; her sled downhill. Although this love of the outdoors and &quot;rough-and-tumble&quot; play was common to many youngsters, some biographers have characterized the young Earhart as a [[tomboy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refRich1989|Rich 1989]], p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The girls kept &quot;worms, moths, [[Tettigoniidae|katydids]] and a tree toad&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLovell1989|Lovell 1989]], p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; in a growing collection gathered in their outings. In 1904, with the help of her uncle, she cobbled together a home-made ramp fashioned after a roller coaster she had seen on a trip to [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] and secured the ramp to the roof of the family toolshed. Earhart's well-documented first flight ended dramatically. She emerged from the broken wooden box that had served as a sled with a bruised lip, torn dress and a &quot;sensation of exhilaration.&quot; She exclaimed, &quot;Oh, Pidge, it's just like flying!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldstein and Dillon p. 9&quot;&gt;[[#refGoldsteinandDillon1997|Goldstein and Dillon 1997]], p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there had been some missteps in his career up to that point, in 1907 Edwin Earhart's job as a claims officer for the [[Rock Island Railroad]] led to a transfer to [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]], Iowa. The next year, at the age of 10,&lt;ref name=&quot;Biography&quot;&gt;[http://www.ameliaearhart.com/about/bio.html &quot;Biography.&quot;] ''The Official Website of Amelia Earhart (The Family of Amelia Earhart)''. Retrieved: June 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Earhart saw her first [[fixed-wing aircraft|aircraft]] at the [[Iowa State Fair]] in Des Moines.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refGoldsteinandDillon1997|Goldstein and Dillon 1997]], p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMorrissey1963|Morrissey 1963]], pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Her father tried to interest her and her sister in taking a flight. One look at the rickety &quot;flivver&quot; was enough for Earhart, who promptly asked if they could go back to the merry-go-round.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refRandolph1987|Randolph 1987]], p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; She later described the biplane as &quot;a thing of rusty wire and wood and not at all interesting.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLovell1989|Lovell 1989]], p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
The two sisters, Amelia and Muriel (she went by her middle name from her teens on), remained with their grandparents in Atchison, while their parents moved into new, smaller quarters in Des Moines. During this period, Earhart received a form of home-schooling together with her sister, from her mother and a governess. She later recounted that she was &quot;exceedingly fond of reading&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hamill 1976, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; and spent countless hours in the large family library. In 1909, when the family was finally reunited in Des Moines, the Earhart children were enrolled in public school for the first time with Amelia Earhart entering the seventh grade at the age of 12 years.

===Family fortunes===
While the family's finances seemingly improved with the acquisition of a new house and even the hiring of two servants, it soon became apparent that Edwin was an alcoholic. Five years later in 1914, he was forced to retire and although he attempted to rehabilitate himself through treatment, he was never reinstated at the Rock Island Railroad. At about this time, Earhart's grandmother Amelia Otis died suddenly, leaving a substantial estate that placed her daughter's share in a trust, fearing that Edwin's drinking would drain the funds. The Otis house, and all of its contents, was auctioned; Earhart was heartbroken and later described it as the end of her childhood.&lt;ref&gt;Garst 1947, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1915, after a long search, Earhart's father found work as a clerk at the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]] in St. Paul, Minnesota, where Earhart entered [[Central High School (Saint Paul, Minnesota)|Central High School]] as a junior. Edwin applied for a transfer to [[Springfield, Missouri|Springfield]], Missouri, in 1915 but the current claims officer reconsidered his retirement and demanded his job back, leaving the elder Earhart with nowhere to go. Facing another calamitous move, Amy Earhart took her children to Chicago, where they lived with friends. Earhart made an unusual condition in the choice of her next schooling; she canvassed nearby high schools in Chicago to find the best science program. She rejected the high school nearest her home when she complained that the chemistry lab was &quot;just like a kitchen sink.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Blau 1977, pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; She eventually enrolled in [[Hyde Park Career Academy|Hyde Park High School]] but spent a miserable semester where a yearbook caption captured the essence of her unhappiness, &quot;A.E. – the girl in brown who walks alone.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refRich1989|Rich 1989]], p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Earhart graduated from Chicago's Hyde Park High School in 1916.&lt;ref name=&quot;Long 1999, p. 33&quot;&gt;[[#refLong1999|Long 1999]], p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout her troubled childhood, she had continued to aspire to a future career; she kept a scrapbook of newspaper clippings about successful women in predominantly male-oriented fields, including film direction and production, law, advertising, management and mechanical engineering.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biography&quot;/&gt; She began junior college at [[Penn State Abington|Ogontz School]] in [[Rydal, Pennsylvania|Rydal]], Pennsylvania, but did not complete her program.&lt;ref&gt;Kerby 1990, pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Although a good student, Earhart cut short her time at Ogontz when she became a nursing assistant in Canada.|group=N}}

During Christmas vacation in 1917, Earhart visited her sister in [[Toronto]]. [[World War I]] had been raging and Earhart saw the returning wounded soldiers. After receiving training as a [[Certified Nursing Assistant|nurse's aide]] from the [[Red Cross]], she began work with the [[Volunteer Aid Detachment]] at [[1 Spadina Crescent|Spadina Military Hospital]]. Her duties included preparing food in the kitchen for patients with special diets and handing out prescribed medication in the hospital's dispensary.&lt;ref name=&quot;nurseaide&quot;&gt;Popplewell, Brett.

===Spanish flu pandemic of 1918===
When the 1918 [[Spanish flu]] pandemic reached Toronto, Earhart was engaged in arduous nursing duties that included night shifts at the Spadina Military Hospital.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lovell p27&quot;&gt;[[#refLovell1989|Lovell 1989]], p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;AE 1932&quot;&gt;Earhart 1932, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; She became a patient herself, suffering from pneumonia and [[Maxillary sinus|maxillary]] [[sinusitis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lovell p27&quot;/&gt; She was hospitalized in early November 1918, owing to pneumonia, and discharged in December 1918, about two months after the illness had started.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lovell p27&quot;/&gt; Her [[sinus (anatomy)|sinus]]-related symptoms were pain and pressure around one eye and copious mucus drainage via the nostrils and throat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Backus p49-50&quot;&gt;Backus 1982, pp. 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt; While staying in the hospital during the pre-antibiotic era, she had painful minor operations to wash out the affected maxillary sinus,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lovell p27&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;AE 1932&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Backus p49-50&quot;/&gt; but these procedures were not successful and Earhart subsequently suffered from worsening headaches. Her convalescence lasted nearly a year, which she spent at her sister's home in [[Northampton, Massachusetts|Northampton]], Massachusetts.&lt;ref name = &quot;AE 1932&quot;/&gt; She passed the time by reading poetry, learning to play the banjo and studying mechanics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lovell p27&quot;/&gt; Chronic sinusitis significantly affected Earhart's flying and activities in later life,&lt;ref name=&quot;Backus p49-50&quot;/&gt; and sometimes even on the airfield she was forced to wear a bandage on her cheek to cover a small drainage tube.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refRich1989|Rich 1989]], pp. 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early flying experiences===
At about that time, Earhart and a young woman friend visited an air fair held in conjunction with the [[Canadian National Exhibition|Canadian National Exposition]] in Toronto. One of the highlights of the day was a flying exhibition put on by a World War I [[Flying ace|ace]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refEarhart1937|Earhart 1937]], p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The pilot overhead spotted Earhart and her friend, who were watching from an isolated clearing, and dived at them. &quot;I am sure he said to himself, 'Watch me make them scamper,'&quot; she said. Earhart stood her ground as the aircraft came close. &quot;I did not understand it at the time,&quot; she said, &quot;but I believe that little red airplane said something to me as it swished by.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refEarhart1937|Earhart 1937]], p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], on December 28, 1920, Earhart and her father visited an airfield where [[Frank Monroe Hawks|Frank Hawks]] (who later gained fame as an [[air racing|air racer]]) gave her a ride that would forever change Earhart's life. &quot;By the time I had got two or three hundred feet [60&amp;ndash;90&amp;nbsp;m] off the ground,&quot; she said, &quot;I knew I had to fly.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refEarhart1937|Earhart 1937]], p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; After that 10-minute flight (that cost her father $10), she immediately became determined to learn to fly. Working at a variety of jobs, including photographer, truck driver, and [[stenographer]] at the local telephone company, she managed to save $1,000 for flying lessons. Earhart had her first lessons, beginning on January 3, 1921, at Kinner Field, near Long Beach. In order to reach the airfield, Earhart had to take a bus to the end of the line, then walk four miles (6&amp;nbsp;km). Earhart's mother also provided part of the $1,000 &quot;stake&quot; against her &quot;better judgement.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aviationhistory.org/ah_Amelia_Earhart.html &quot;Lady Lindy, Amelia Earhart's Life History.&quot;] ''aviationhistory.org''.

Earhart arrived with her father and a singular request, &quot;I want to fly. Will you teach me?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Marshall 2007, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Earhart's commitment to flying required her to accept the frequently hard work and rudimentary conditions that accompanied early aviation training. She chose a leather jacket, but aware that other aviators would be judging her, she slept in it for three nights to give the jacket a &quot;worn&quot; look. To complete her image transformation, she also cropped her hair short in the style of other female flyers.&lt;ref&gt;Blau 1977, pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Six months later, Earhart purchased a secondhand bright yellow [[Kinner Airster]] [[biplane]] which she nicknamed &quot;The Canary.&quot; On October 22, 1922, Earhart flew the Airster to an altitude of {{convert|14000|ft|m}}, setting a world record for female pilots.

Throughout this period, her grandmother's inheritance, which was now administered by her mother, was constantly depleted until it finally ran out of money following a disastrous investment in a failed [[gypsum]] mine. Consequently, with no immediate prospects for recouping her investment in flying, Earhart sold the &quot;Canary&quot; as well as a second Kinner and bought a yellow [[Kissel Motor Car Company|Kissel]] &quot;Speedster&quot; two-passenger automobile, which she named the &quot;Yellow Peril.&quot; Simultaneously, Earhart experienced an exacerbation of her old sinus problem as her pain worsened and in early 1924 she was hospitalized for another sinus operation, which was again unsuccessful. After trying her hand at a number of unusual ventures that included setting up a photography company, Earhart set out in a new direction.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refGoldsteinandDillon1997|Goldstein and Dillon 1997]], p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Following her parents' divorce in 1924, she drove her mother in the &quot;Yellow Peril&quot; on a transcontinental trip from California with stops throughout the West and even a jaunt up to [[Banff, Alberta]]. The meandering tour eventually brought the pair to [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], where Earhart underwent another sinus operation, which was more successful. After recuperation, she returned to Columbia University for several months but was forced to abandon her studies and any further plans for enrolling at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] because her mother could no longer afford the tuition fees and associated costs. Soon after, she found employment first as a teacher, then as a [[social worker]] in 1925 at [[Denison House (Boston)|Denison House]], living in [[Medford, Massachusetts|Medford]], Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.purdue.edu/spcol/aearhart/biog.php |title=&quot;Amelia Earhart Biographical Sketch.&quot; |accessdate=2009-12-31 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080401003450/http://www.lib.purdue.edu/spcol/aearhart/biog.php |archivedate=April 1, 2008 |df=mdy }} ''George Palmer Putnam Collection of Amelia Earhart Papers, Purdue University.''

===Transatlantic flight in 1928===

After [[Charles Lindbergh]]'s solo flight across the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] in 1927, Amy Guest (1873–1959) expressed interest in being the first woman to fly (or be flown) across the Atlantic Ocean. After deciding that the trip was too perilous for her to undertake, she offered to sponsor the project, suggesting that they find &quot;another girl with the right image.&quot; While at work one afternoon in April 1928, Earhart got a phone call from Capt. Hilton H. Railey, who asked her, &quot;Would you like to fly the Atlantic?&quot;

The project coordinators (including book publisher and publicist [[George P. Putnam]]) interviewed Earhart and asked her to accompany pilot [[Wilmer Stultz]] and copilot/mechanic Louis Gordon on the flight, nominally as a passenger, but with the added duty of keeping the flight log. The team departed from [[Trepassey, Newfoundland and Labrador|Trepassey Harbor]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] in a [[Fokker F.VII]]b/3m on June 17, 1928, landing at [[Pwll]] near [[Burry Port]], South Wales, exactly 20 hours and 40 minutes later.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan 1979, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a commemorative [[blue plaque]] at the site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/3540051]&lt;/ref&gt; Since most of the flight was on instruments and Earhart had no training for this type of flying, she did not pilot the aircraft. When interviewed after landing, she said, &quot;Stultz did all the flying—had to. I was just baggage, like a sack of potatoes.&quot; She added, &quot;...maybe someday I'll try it alone.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refGoldsteinandDillon1997|Goldstein and Dillon 1997]], p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Earhart reportedly received a rousing welcome on June 19, 1928, when she landed at [[Woolston, Hampshire|Woolston]] in [[Southampton]], England.&lt;ref&gt;''Southampton: A pictorial peep into the past''. Southern Newspapers Ltd, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; She flew the [[Avro Avian]] 594 Avian III, SN: R3/AV/101 owned by [[Lady Mary Heath]] and later purchased the aircraft and had it shipped back to the United States (where it was assigned &quot;unlicensed aircraft identification mark&quot; 7083).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goldenwingsmuseum.com/collection/AC-Pages/Avro%20Avian.html &quot;1927 Avro Avian.&quot;]  ''goldenwingsmuseum.com.'' Retrieved: July 1, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Stultz, Gordon and Earhart flight crew returned to the United States, they were greeted with a [[ticker-tape parade]] along the  [[Canyon of Heroes]] in Manhattan, followed by a reception with [[President of the United States|President]] [[Calvin Coolidge]] at the [[White House]].

Meanwhile, Putnam had undertaken to heavily promote her in a campaign that included publishing a book she authored, a series of new lecture tours and using pictures of her in mass market endorsements for products including luggage, [[Lucky Strike]] cigarettes (this caused image problems for her, with ''[[McCall's]]'' magazine retracting an offer)&lt;ref name=&quot;Pearce p. 76&quot;&gt;Pearce 1988, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; and women's clothing and sportswear. The money that she made with &quot;Lucky Strike&quot; had been earmarked for a $1,500 donation to Commander [[Richard Evelyn Byrd|Richard Byrd]]'s imminent South Pole expedition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pearce p. 76&quot;/&gt;

The marketing campaign by both Earhart and Putnam was successful in establishing the Earhart mystique in the public psyche.&lt;ref&gt;Crouch, Tom D.

Retrieved: July 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than simply endorsing the products, Earhart actively became involved in the promotions, especially in women's fashions. For a number of years she had sewn her own clothes, but the &quot;active living&quot; lines that were sold in 50 stores such as [[Macy's]] in metropolitan areas were an expression of a new Earhart image.&lt;ref&gt;V Morell (1998) Amelia Earhart.

She was a Vice President of National Airways, which conducted the flying operations of the Boston-Maine Airways and several other airlines in the northeast.&lt;ref&gt;''Boston and Maine Railroad Employees Magazine'', Volume 8, Number 10, July 1933, copy in Purdue University Special Collections.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1940, it had become [[Northeast Airlines]].

===Competitive flying===
Although Earhart had gained fame for her transatlantic flight, she endeavored to set an &quot;untarnished&quot; record of her own.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refRich1989|Rich 1989]], p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after her return, piloting Avian ''7083'', she set off on her first long solo flight that occurred just as her name was coming into the national spotlight. By making the trip in August 1928, Earhart became the first woman to fly solo across the North American continent and back.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mendieta&quot;&gt;Mendieta, Carlene. [http://www.ameliaflight.com/ameliaflight/flight.po &quot;Amelia Earhart's Flight Across America: Rediscovering a Legend.&quot;] ''ameliaflight.com''. Retrieved: May 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Her piloting skills and professionalism gradually grew, as acknowledged by experienced professional pilots who flew with her. General Leigh Wade flew with Earhart in 1929: &quot;She was a born flier, with a delicate touch on the stick.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refRich1989|Rich 1989]], p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Earhart subsequently made her first attempt at competitive air racing in 1929 during the first Santa Monica-to-Cleveland [[Women's Air Derby]] (nicknamed the &quot;Powder Puff Derby&quot; by [[Will Rogers]]), which left Santa Monica on August 18 and arrived at Cleveland on August 26. During the race, she settled into fourth place in the &quot;heavy planes&quot; division. At the second last stop at Columbus, her friend [[Ruth Nichols]], who was coming third, had an accident while on a test flight before the race recommenced. Nichols' aircraft hit a tractor at the start of the runway and flipped over, forcing her out of the race.&lt;ref&gt;Lauber 1989, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; At Cleveland, Earhart was placed third in the heavy division.&lt;ref&gt;Jessen 2002, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''San Bernardino County Sun''. August 26, 1929.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930, Earhart became an official of the [[National Aeronautic Association]] where she actively promoted the establishment of separate women's records and was instrumental in the [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]] (FAI) accepting a similar international standard.&lt;ref name=&quot;Glines 1997, p. 45&quot;/&gt; In 1931, flying a [[Pitcairn PCA-2]] [[autogyro]], she set a world altitude record of 18,415 feet (5,613 m) in a borrowed company machine.&lt;ref&gt;Van Pelt 2008, pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt; While to a reader today it might seem that Earhart was engaged in flying &quot;stunts,&quot; she was, with other female flyers, crucial to making the American public &quot;air minded&quot; and convincing them that &quot;aviation was no longer just for daredevils and supermen.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Corn 1983, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, Earhart became involved with The [[Ninety-Nines]], an organization of female pilots providing moral support and advancing the cause of women in aviation. She had called a meeting of female pilots in 1929 following the Women's Air Derby. She suggested the name based on the number of the charter members; she later became the organization's first president in 1930.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lovell 1989, p. 152&quot;/&gt; Earhart was a vigorous advocate for female pilots and when the 1934 [[Bendix Trophy Race]] banned women, she openly refused to fly screen actress [[Mary Pickford]] to Cleveland to open the races.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOakes1985|Oakes 1985]], p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage to George Putnam===
[[File:Amelia Earhart and husband George Putnam 1931.jpg|thumb|left|Earhart and Putnam in 1931]]
For a while, Earhart was engaged to Samuel Chapman, a chemical engineer from Boston; she broke off the engagement on November 23, 1928.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLovell1989|Lovell 1989]], pp. 130, 138.&lt;/ref&gt; During the same period, Earhart and publisher [[George P. Putnam]] had spent a great deal of time together. Putnam, who was known as GP, was divorced in 1929 and sought out Earhart, proposing to her six times before she finally agreed to marry him.{{refn|Quote: &quot;Amelia eventually said yes – or rather nodded yes – to GP's sixth proposal of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce 1988, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}} After substantial hesitation on her part, they married on February 7, 1931, in Putnam's mother's house in Noank, Connecticut. Earhart referred to her marriage as a &quot;partnership&quot; with &quot;dual control.&quot; In a letter written to Putnam and hand delivered to him on the day of the wedding, she wrote, &quot;I want you to understand I shall not hold you to any midaevil {{Sic}} code of faithfulness to me nor shall I consider myself bound to you similarly.&quot;{{refn|Quote: &quot;It was pencilled longhand... a slip or two in spelling meticulously corrected.&quot; The later typewritten note has the word medieval incorrectly spelled.

Earhart's ideas on marriage were liberal for the time as she believed in equal responsibilities for both breadwinners and pointedly kept her own name rather than being referred to as &quot;Mrs. Putnam.&quot; When ''The New York Times'', per the rules of its stylebook, insisted on referring to her as Mrs. Putnam, she laughed it off.

On January 11, 1935, Earhart became the first aviator to fly solo from [[Honolulu]], Hawaii to [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], California.{{refn|The first flight between California and Hawaii was completed on June 28–29, 1927 by the Army Air Corps tri-motor ''[[Bird of Paradise (aircraft)|Bird of Paradise]].|group=N}} Although this transoceanic flight had been attempted by many others, notably by the unfortunate participants in the 1927 [[Dole Air Race]] that had reversed the route, her trailblazing&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldstein and Dillon p. 132.&quot;&gt;[[#refGoldsteinandDillon1997|Goldstein and Dillon 1997]], p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; flight had been mainly routine, with no mechanical breakdowns. In her final hours, she even relaxed and listened to &quot;the broadcast of the Metropolitan Opera from New York.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldstein and Dillon p. 132.&quot;/&gt;

That year, once more flying her faithful Vega that Earhart had tagged &quot;old Bessie, the fire horse,&quot;{{refn|&quot;Old Bessie&quot; started out as a Vega 5 built in 1928 as c/n 36, but was modified with a replacement fuselage to become a 5B.&lt;ref&gt;Allen 1964, pp. 199, 200, 202.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}} she flew solo from Los Angeles to Mexico City on April 19. The next record attempt was a nonstop flight from Mexico City to New York. Setting off on May 8, her flight was uneventful although the large crowds that greeted her at [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], New Jersey were a concern,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLovell1989|Lovell 1989]], p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; because she had to be careful not to taxi into the throng.

Earhart again participated in long-distance air racing, placing fifth in the 1935 [[Bendix Trophy|Bendix Trophy Race]], the best result she could manage considering that her stock Lockheed Vega, topping out at {{convert|195|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, was outclassed by purpose-built air racers that reached more than {{convert|300|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOakes1985|Oakes 1985]], p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; The race had been a particularly difficult one as a competitor, Cecil Allen, died in a fiery takeoff mishap and rival Jacqueline Cochran was forced to pull out due to mechanical problems, the &quot;blinding fog&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;[[#refGoldsteinandDillon1997|Goldstein and Dillon 1997]], p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; and violent thunderstorms that plagued the race.

Between 1930 and 1935, Earhart had set seven women's speed and distance aviation records in a variety of aircraft including the Kinner Airster, Lockheed Vega, and Pitcairn Autogiro. By 1935, recognizing the limitations of her &quot;lovely red Vega&quot; in long, transoceanic flights, Earhart contemplated, in her own words, a new &quot;prize... one flight which I most wanted to attempt – a circumnavigation of the globe as near its waistline as could be.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refEarhart1937|Earhart 1937]], p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; For the new venture, she would need a new aircraft.

==Move from New York to California==
While Earhart was away on a speaking tour in late November 1934, a fire broke out at the Putnam residence in Rye, destroying many family treasures and Earhart's personal mementos.&lt;ref&gt;Lovell 1989, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; Putnam had already sold his interest in the New York based publishing company to his cousin, [[Palmer Cosslett Putnam|Palmer Putnam]]. Following the fire, the couple decided to move to the West Coast, where Putnam took up his new position as head of the editorial board of [[Paramount Pictures]] in [[Hollywood|North Hollywood]].&lt;ref&gt;Sloate 1990, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Amelia preferred the more benign weather of the west coast for flying and based her later years' operation from California rather than the east coast.|group=N}} While speaking in California in late 1934, Earhart had contacted Hollywood &quot;stunt&quot; pilot [[Paul Mantz]] in order to improve her flying, focusing especially on long-distance flying in her Vega and wanted to move closer to him.

At Earhart's urging, Putnam purchased a small house in June 1935 adjacent to the clubhouse of the Lakeside Golf Club in [[Toluca Lake, Los Angeles|Toluca Lake]], a [[San Fernando Valley]] celebrity enclave community nestled between the [[Warner Brothers]] and [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] studio complexes where they had earlier rented a temporary residence.&lt;ref&gt;Altman, Elizabeth.

This delayed the occupation of their new home for several months.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refButler1997|Butler 1997]], p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1935, Earhart and Mantz formally established a business partnership that they had been considering since late 1934 by creating the short-lived Earhart-Mantz Flying School, which Mantz controlled and operated through his aviation company, United Air Services. The company was located at the [[Burbank Airport]], about five miles (8 km) from Earhart's Toluca Lake home. Putnam handled publicity for the school that primarily taught instrument flying using [[Link Trainer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLong1999|Long 1999]], pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Planning===
Earhart joined the faculty of Purdue University in 1935 as a visiting faculty member to counsel women on careers and as a technical advisor to the Department of Aeronautics.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;{{refn|Her job at Purdue was outlined by Edward C. Elliott, the President of Purdue University.|group=N}} Early in 1936, Earhart started to plan a round-the-world flight. Not the first to circle the globe, it would be the longest at 29,000 miles (47,000&amp;nbsp;km), following a grueling equatorial route. With financing from Purdue,{{refn|Purdue University established the Amelia Earhart Fund for Aeronautical Research at $50,000 to fund the purchase of the Lockheed Electra 10E.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldstein and Dillon p.150&quot;/&gt;|group=N}} in July 1936, a [[Lockheed Model 10 Electra|Lockheed Electra 10E]] was built at [[Lockheed Aircraft Company]] to her specifications, which included extensive modifications to the fuselage to incorporate a large fuel tank.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pacificwrecks.com/aircraft/electra/1055.html &quot;Lockheed Model 10E Electra c/n: 1055 Reg: NR16020.&quot;] ''PacificWrecks.com,'' January 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Earhart dubbed the twin engine monoplane airliner her &quot;flying laboratory&quot; and hangared it at Mantz's United Air Services located just across the airfield from Lockheed's [[Burbank, California]] plant in which it had been built.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLong1999|Long 1999]], p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Electra was publicized as a &quot;flying laboratory&quot;, little useful science was planned and the flight was arranged around Earhart's intention to circumnavigate the globe along with gathering raw material and public attention for her next book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20A1FF83C5E167B93C2AB178FD85F428385F9&amp;scp=1 &quot;Miss Earhart to get 'Flying Laboratory'.&quot;] ''The New York Times'', April 20, 1936, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Her first choice as navigator was Captain Harry Manning, who had been the captain of the {{SS|President Roosevelt|1921|2}}, the ship that had brought Earhart back from Europe in 1928.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldstein and Dillon p.150&quot;&gt;[[#refGoldsteinandDillon1997|Goldstein and Dillon 1997]], p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through contacts in the Los Angeles aviation community, [[Fred Noonan]] was subsequently chosen as a second [[flight officer|navigator]] because there were significant additional factors which had to be dealt with while using celestial navigation for aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLong1999|Long 1999]], p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Post and Gatty 1931, pp. 45–56.&lt;/ref&gt; He had vast experience in both marine (he was a licensed ship's captain) and [[air navigation|flight navigation]]. Noonan had recently left [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]], where he established most of the company's [[China Clipper]] seaplane routes across the Pacific. Noonan had also been responsible for training Pan American's navigators for the route between [[San Francisco]] and [[Manila]].&lt;ref&gt;Grooch 1936, pp. 177, 189.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Noonan also navigated the China Clipper on its first flight to Manila, departing Alameda under the command of Captain Ed Musick, on November 22, 1935.|group=N}} The original plans were for Noonan to navigate from Hawaii to Howland Island, a particularly difficult portion of the flight; then Manning would continue with Earhart to Australia and she would proceed on her own for the remainder of the project.

===First attempt===
&lt;!--Copyright concerns, do not readd until cleared [[File:Mantz, Ae,Manning, Noonan.jpg|thumb|L–R, [[Paul Mantz]], Amelia Earhart, Harry Manning and [[Fred Noonan]], [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], California, March 17, 1937]]--&gt;
On March 17, 1937, Earhart and her crew flew the first leg from [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], California to [[Honolulu]], Hawaii. In addition to Earhart and Noonan, Harry Manning and Mantz (who was acting as Earhart's technical advisor) were on board. Due to lubrication and galling problems with the propeller hubs' variable pitch mechanisms, the aircraft needed servicing in Hawaii. Ultimately, the Electra ended up at the United States Navy's Luke Field on [[Ford Island]] in [[Pearl Harbor]]. The flight resumed three days later from Luke Field with Earhart, Noonan and Manning on board. During the takeoff run, Earhart [[ground loop (aviation)|ground-looped]], circumstances of which remain controversial. Some witnesses at Luke Field including the Associated Press journalist on the scene said they saw a tire blow.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rich p.245&quot;&gt;[[#refRich1989|Rich 1989]], p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; Earhart thought either the Electra's right tire had blown and/or the right landing gear had collapsed. Some sources, including Mantz, cited pilot error.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rich p.245&quot;/&gt;

With the aircraft severely damaged, the flight was called off and the aircraft was shipped by sea to the Lockheed Burbank facility for repairs.&lt;ref&gt;Leder 1987, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second attempt===
[[File:Amelia Earhart flight route.svg|right|thumb|246x246px|The planned flight route]]
While the Electra was being repaired Earhart and Putnam secured additional funds and prepared for a second attempt. This time flying west to east, the second attempt began with an unpublicized flight from Oakland to [[Miami]], Florida, and after arriving there Earhart publicly announced her plans to circumnavigate the globe. The flight's opposite direction was partly the result of changes in global wind and weather patterns along the planned route since the earlier attempt. On this second flight, Fred Noonan was Earhart's only crew member. The pair departed Miami on June 1 and after numerous stops in South America, Africa, the [[Indian subcontinent]] and Southeast Asia, arrived at [[Lae]], [[Territory of New Guinea|New Guinea]], on June 29, 1937. At this stage about 22,000 miles (35,000&amp;nbsp;km) of the journey had been completed. The remaining 7,000 miles (11,000&amp;nbsp;km) would be over the Pacific.

===Departure from Lae===
On July 2, 1937, midnight [[GMT]], Earhart and Noonan took off from [[Lae Airfield]] in the heavily loaded Electra. Their intended destination was [[Howland Island]], a flat sliver of land 6,500&amp;nbsp;ft (2,000 m) long and 1,600&amp;nbsp;ft (500 m) wide, 10&amp;nbsp;ft (3 m) high and 2,556 miles (4,113&amp;nbsp;km) away.{{fails verification|reason=Math does not work out.|date=November 2016}} Their last known position report was near the [[Nukumanu Islands]], about 800 miles (1,300&amp;nbsp;km) into the flight. The [[USCGC Itasca (1929)|USCGC ''Itasca'']] was on station at Howland, assigned to communicate with Earhart's Electra and guide them to the island once they arrived in the vicinity.

===Final approach to Howland Island===
Through a series of misunderstandings or errors (the details of which are still controversial), the final approach to Howland Island using [[radio navigation]] was not successful. Fred Noonan had earlier written about problems affecting the accuracy of radio direction finding in navigation.{{refn|Noonan, Fred. ''Memo to Operations Manager, Pacific Division, Pan American Airlines'', April 29, 1935: &quot;The inaccuracies of direction finding bearings can be very definitely cataloged: twilight effects, faint signals, wide splits of minima and inaccurate calibration.&quot;|group=N}} Another cited cause of possible confusion was that the ''Itasca'' and Earhart planned their communication schedule using time systems set a half-hour apart, with Earhart using Greenwich Civil Time (GCT) and the ''Itasca'' under a Naval time zone designation system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoversten&quot;&gt;Hoversten 2007, pp. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sources have noted Earhart's apparent lack of understanding of her direction-finding system, which had been fitted to the aircraft just prior to the flight. The system was equipped with a new receiver from Bendix that operated on five wavelength &quot;bands&quot;, marked 1 to 5. The [[loop antenna]] was equipped with a tuneable [[loading coil]] that changed the effective length of the antenna to allow it to work efficiently at different wavelengths. The tuner on the antenna was also marked with five settings, 1 to 5, but, critically, these were not the same frequency bands as the corresponding bands on the radio. The two were close enough for settings 1, 2 and 3, but the higher frequency settings, 4 and 5, were entirely different. Earhart's only training on the system was a brief introduction by Joe Gurr at the Lockheed factory, and the topic had not come up. A card displaying the band settings of the antenna was mounted so it was not visible. Gurr explained that higher frequency bands would offer better accuracy and longer range.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLong1999|Long 1999]], p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

Motion picture evidence from Lae suggests that an [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] mounted underneath the fuselage may have been torn off from the fuel-heavy Electra during taxi or takeoff from Lae's turf runway, though no antenna was reported found at Lae. Don Dwiggins, in his biography of Paul Mantz (who assisted Earhart and Noonan in their flight planning), noted that the aviators had cut off their long-wire antenna, due to the annoyance of having to crank it back into the aircraft after each use.

===Radio signals===
&lt;!--Copyright concerns, do not readd until cleared [[File:Amelia 1936.jpg|thumb|right|Earhart in the [[Lockheed Model 10 Electra|Electra]] cockpit, c. 1936]]--&gt;
During Earhart and Noonan's approach to Howland Island, the ''Itasca'' received strong and clear voice transmissions from Earhart identifying as KHAQQ but she apparently was unable to hear voice transmissions from the ship. Signals from the ship would also be used for direction finding, implying that the aircraft's direction finder was also not functional.

The first calls, routine reports stating the weather as cloudy and overcast, were received at 2:45 and just before 5&amp;nbsp;am on July 2. These calls were broken up by static, but at this point the aircraft would still be a long distance from Howland.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFleming2011|Fleming 2011]], p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

At 6:14&amp;nbsp;am another call was received stating the aircraft was within {{convert|200|miles|km}}, and requested that the ship use its direction finder to provide a bearing for the aircraft. Earhart began whistling into the microphone to provide a continual signal for them to home in on.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFleming2011|Fleming 2011]], p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; It was at this point that the radio operators on the ''Itasca'' realized that their RDF system could not tune in the aircraft's 3015&amp;nbsp;kHz frequency; radioman Leo Bellarts later commented that he &quot;was sitting there sweating blood because I couldn't do a darn thing about it.&quot; A similar call asking for a bearing was received at 6:45&amp;nbsp;am, when Earhart estimated they were {{convert|100|miles|km}} out.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFleming2011|Fleming 2011]], p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

At 7:42&amp;nbsp;am Earhart radioed &quot;We must be on you, but cannot see you—but gas is running low. Have been unable to reach you by radio. We are flying at 1,000 feet [305 m].&quot; Her 7:58&amp;nbsp;am transmission said she couldn't hear the ''Itasca'' and asked them to send voice signals so she could try to take a radio bearing. This transmission was reported by the ''Itasca'' as the loudest possible signal, indicating Earhart and Noonan were in the immediate area. They couldn't send voice at the frequency she asked for, so Morse code signals were sent instead. Earhart acknowledged receiving these but said she was unable to determine their direction.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, Randall S., PhD. [http://tighar.org/Projects/Earhart/Research/ResearchPapers/Worldflight/finalflight3.html &quot;The Final Flight. Part 3: At Howland Island.&quot;] ''tighar.org'', 2009. Retrieved: July 10, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her last known transmission at 8:43&amp;nbsp;am Earhart broadcast &quot;We are on the line 157 337. We will repeat this message. We will repeat this on 6210 kilocycles. Wait.&quot; However, a few moments later she was back on the same frequency (3105&amp;nbsp;kHz) with a transmission which was logged as a &quot;questionable&quot;: &quot;We are running on line north and south.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tighar.org/Projects/Earhart/forum/FAQs/navigation.html &quot;Earhart Navigation FAQ.&quot;] ''tighar.org''. Retrieved: July 10, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Earhart's transmissions seemed to indicate she and Noonan believed they had reached Howland's charted position, which was incorrect by about five nautical miles (10&amp;nbsp;km). The ''Itasca'' used her oil-fired boilers to generate smoke for a period of time but the fliers apparently did not see it. The many scattered clouds in the area around Howland Island have also been cited as a problem: their dark shadows on the ocean surface may have been almost indistinguishable from the island's subdued and very flat profile.

Whether any post-loss radio signals were received from Earhart and Noonan remains unclear. If transmissions were received from the Electra, most if not all were weak and hopelessly garbled. Earhart's voice transmissions to Howland were on 3105&amp;nbsp;kHz, a frequency restricted to aviation use in the United States by the FCC.{{refn|Quote: &quot;Frequencies between 2,504 to 3,497.5 kc were allocated to &quot;Coastal harbor, government, aviation, fixed, miscellaneous.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;American Radio Relay League 1945, p. 453.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}} This frequency was not thought to be fit for broadcasts over great distances. When Earhart was at cruising altitude and midway between Lae and Howland (over {{convert|1000|mi|km}} from each) neither station heard her scheduled transmission at 0815 GCT.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLong1999|Long 1999]], p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the 50-watt transmitter used by Earhart was attached to a less-than-optimum-length V-type antenna.&lt;ref&gt;Everette, Michael.

The last voice transmission received on Howland Island from Earhart indicated she and Noonan were flying along a line of position (taken from a &quot;sun line&quot; running on 157–337 degrees) which Noonan would have calculated and drawn on a chart as passing through Howland.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSaffordetal2003|Safford et al.]] 2003, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Safford disputes a &quot;sun line&quot; theory and proposes that Noonan asked Earhart to fly 157–337 magnetic or to fly at right angles to the original track on north–south courses.|group=N}} After all contact was lost with Howland Island, attempts were made to reach the flyers with both voice and [[Morse code]] transmissions. Operators across the Pacific and the United States may have heard signals from the downed Electra but these were unintelligible or weak.&lt;ref&gt;Brandenberg, Bob.

===Search efforts===
Beginning approximately one hour after Earhart's last recorded message, the USCGC ''Itasca'' undertook an ultimately unsuccessful search north and west of Howland Island based on initial assumptions about transmissions from the aircraft. The [[United States Navy]] soon joined the search and over a period of about three days sent available resources to the search area in the vicinity of Howland Island. The initial search by the ''Itasca'' involved running up the 157/337 line of position to the NNW from Howland Island. The ''Itasca'' then searched the area to the immediate NE of the island, corresponding to the area, yet wider than the area searched to the NW. Based on bearings of several supposed Earhart radio transmissions, some of the search efforts were directed to a specific position on a line of 281 degrees (approximately northwest) from Howland Island without evidence of the flyers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldstein and Dillon p. 251&quot;&gt;[[#refGoldsteinandDillon1997|Goldstein and Dillon 1997]] p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; Four days after Earhart's last verified radio transmission, on July 6, 1937, the captain of the battleship ''Colorado'' received orders from the Commandant, [[United States Naval Districts#14th Naval District|Fourteenth Naval District]] to take over all naval and coast guard units to coordinate search efforts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldstein and Dillon p. 251&quot;/&gt;

Later search efforts were directed to the [[Phoenix Islands]] south of Howland Island.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refGoldsteinandDillon1997|Goldstein and Dillon 1997]], p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; A week after the disappearance, naval aircraft from the ''Colorado'' flew over several islands in the group including Gardner Island (now called [[Nikumaroro]]), which had been uninhabited for over 40 years. The subsequent report on Gardner read: &quot;Here signs of recent habitation were clearly visible but repeated circling and zooming failed to elicit any answering wave from possible inhabitants and it was finally taken for granted that none were there... At the western end of the island a [[tramp trade|tramp steamer]] (of about 4000 tons)... lay high and almost dry head onto the coral beach with her back broken in two places. The lagoon at Gardner looked sufficiently deep and certainly large enough so that a seaplane or even an airboat could have landed or takenoff {{sic}} in any direction with little if any difficulty. Given a chance, it is believed that Miss Earhart could have landed her aircraft in this lagoon and swum or waded ashore.&quot;{{refn|Memo from Senior Aviator, USS ''Colorado'', to The Chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics, &quot;Aircraft Search of Earhart Plane.&quot; Their commander Capt Friedell made no note of &quot;recent habitation&quot; in his official summary.&lt;ref&gt;''Finding Amelia''  DVD, Annapolis, Maryland: Naval Institute Press, 2006. DVD: Contents: Reports: Lambrecht.pdf, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}} They also found that Gardner's shape and size as recorded on charts were wholly inaccurate. Other Navy search efforts were again directed north, west and southwest of Howland Island, based on a possibility the Electra had ditched in the ocean, was afloat, or that the aviators were in an emergency raft.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refGoldsteinandDillon1997|Goldstein and Dillon 1997]], p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

The official search efforts lasted until July 19, 1937.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSaffordetal2003|Safford et al.]] 2003, pp. 61–62, 67–68.&lt;/ref&gt; At $4&amp;nbsp;million, the air and sea search by the Navy and [[Coast Guard]] was the most costly and intensive in U.S. history up to that time but [[search and rescue]] techniques during the era were rudimentary and some of the search was based on erroneous assumptions and flawed information. Official reporting of the search effort was influenced by individuals wary about how their roles in looking for an American hero might be reported by the press.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refGoldsteinandDillon1997|Goldstein and Dillon 1997]], pp. 254–255.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn| FDR himself had to respond to accusations that the search was justified.|group=N}} Despite an unprecedented search by the United States Navy and Coast Guard, no physical evidence of Earhart, Noonan or the Electra 10E was found. The aircraft carrier USS {{USS|Lexington|CV-2|2}}, the ''Colorado'', and the ''Itasca'' (and even two Japanese ships, the oceanographic survey vessel ''Koshu'' and auxiliary seaplane tender [[Japanese seaplane tender Kamoi|''Kamoi'']]) searched for six–seven days each, covering {{convert|150000|sqmi|km2}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refGoldsteinandDillon1997|Goldstein and Dillon 1997]], pp. 245–254.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;King et al. 2001, pp. 32–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after the end of the official search, Putnam financed a private search by local authorities of nearby Pacific islands and waters, concentrating on the Gilberts. In late July 1937, Putnam chartered two small boats and while he remained in the United States, directed a search of the [[Phoenix Islands]], [[Christmas Island (Kiribati)|Christmas (Kiritimati) Island]], [[Tabuaeran|Fanning (Tabuaeran) Island]], the [[Gilbert Islands]] and the [[Marshall Islands]], but [[List of aerial disappearances|no trace of the Electra or its occupants was found]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refGoldsteinandDillon1997|Goldstein and Dillon 1997]], p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt;

Back in the United States, Putnam acted to become the trustee of Earhart's estate so that he could pay for the searches and related bills. In probate court in Los Angeles, Putnam requested to have the &quot;[[declared death in absentia|declared death ''in absentia'']]&quot; seven-year waiting period waived so that he could manage Earhart's finances. As a result, Earhart was declared legally dead on January 5, 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Van Pelt 2005, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Speculation on disappearance==
Many ideas emerged after the disappearance of Earhart and Noonan. Two possibilities concerning the flyers' fate have prevailed among researchers and historians.

===Crash and sink theory===
Many researchers believe that the Electra ran out of fuel and that Earhart and Noonan ditched at sea. Navigator and aeronautical engineer [[Elgen Long]] and his wife Marie K. Long devoted 35 years of exhaustive research to the &quot;crash and sink&quot; theory, which is the most widely accepted explanation for the disappearance.&lt;ref&gt;Long, Elgen. [http://www.elgenlong.com/amelia.php?view=main &quot;'Crash and Sink' Theory&quot;.] ''elgenlong.com'', 2006. Retrieved: July 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; United States Navy Captain [[Laurance Safford]] (retired) who was responsible for the interwar Mid-Pacific Strategic Direction Finding Net, and the decoding of the Japanese [[Purple (cipher machine)|Purple]] cipher messages for the attack on Pearl Harbor, began a lengthy analysis of the Earhart flight during the 1970s. His research included the intricate radio transmission documentation. Safford came to the conclusion, &quot;poor planning, worse execution&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strippel&quot;&gt;[[#refStrippel1995|Strippel 1995]], p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Rear Admiral Richard R. Black, USN, who was in administrative charge of the Howland Island airstrip and was present in the radio room on the ''Itasca'', asserted in 1982 that &quot;the Electra went into the sea about 10&amp;nbsp;am, July 2, 1937 not far from Howland&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strippel&quot;/&gt; British aviation historian Roy Nesbit interpreted evidence in contemporary accounts and Putnam's correspondence and concluded Earhart's Electra was not fully fueled at Lae.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refStrippel1995|Strippel 1995]], p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; William L. Polhemous, the navigator on [[Ann Pellegreno]]'s 1967 flight which followed Earhart and Noonan's original flight path, studied navigational tables for July 2, 1937, and thought Noonan may have miscalculated the &quot;single line approach&quot; intended to &quot;hit&quot; Howland.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refStrippel1995|Strippel 1995]], pp. 58, 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

David Jourdan, a former Navy submariner and ocean engineer specializing in deep-sea recoveries, has claimed any transmissions attributed to Gardner Island were false. Through his company Nauticos he extensively searched a {{convert|1200|sqmi|km2|sing=on}} quadrant north and west of Howland Island during two deep-sea sonar expeditions (2002 and 2006, total cost $4.5&amp;nbsp;million) and found nothing. The search locations were derived from the line of position (157–337) broadcast by Earhart on July 2, 1937.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoversten&quot;/&gt; Nevertheless, Elgen Long's interpretations have led Jourdan to conclude, &quot;The analysis of all the data we have – the fuel analysis, the radio calls, other things – tells me she went into the water off Howland.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoversten&quot;/&gt; Earhart's stepson George Palmer Putnam Jr. has been quoted as saying he believes &quot;the plane just ran out of gas&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Kleinberg, Eliot.

In part, we remember her because she's our favorite missing person.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoversten&quot; /&gt;

===Gardner Island hypothesis===
The Gardner Island hypothesis assumes that Earhart and Noonan, having not found Howland Island, would not waste time searching for Howland. Instead, they would turn to the south and look for other islands. The 157/337 radio transmission suggests they flew a course of 157&amp;deg; that would take them past Baker Island; if they missed Baker Island, then sometime later they would fly over the [[Phoenix Islands]], now part of the [[Kiribati|Republic of Kiribati]], about {{convert|350|nmi|km}} southsoutheast of Howland Island. The Garner Island hypothesis has the plane making it to Gardner Island (now [[Nikumaroro]]), one of the Phoenix Islands.

As mentioned above, a week after Earhart disappeared, Navy planes from {{USS|Colorado|BB-45|6}} (which had sailed from Pearl Harbor) searched Gardner Island. The planes saw signs of recent habitation and the wreck of the {{SS|Norwich City}}, but did not see any signs of Earhart's plane or people.

After the Navy ended its search, G. P. Putnam undertook a search in the Phoenix Group and other islands,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refRich1989|Rich 1989]], pp. 272–273.&lt;/ref&gt; but nothing was found.

In October 1937, Eric Bevington and Henry E. Maude visited Gardner with some potential settlers. A group walked all the way around the island, but did not find a plane or other evidence.&lt;ref&gt;http://tighar.org/Projects/Earhart/Archives/Documents/Bevington_Diary.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1938, laborers landed on the island and started constructing the settlement.&lt;ref&gt;http://tighar.org/Projects/Earhart/Archives/Documents/Gallagher_Report.html retrieved 7 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Around April 1940, a skull is discovered and buried, but British colonial officer [[Gerald Gallagher]] does not learn of it until September 1940.&lt;ref&gt;http://tighar.org/Projects/Earhart/Archives/Documents/Bones_Chronology.html retrieved 7 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1940, Gallagher, a licensed pilot, instituted a search and then radioed his superiors that he had found a &quot;[[skeleton]] ... possibly that of a woman,&quot; along with an old-fashioned [[sextant]] box, under a tree on the island's southeast corner. He was ordered to send the remains to [[Fiji]]. Gallagher believed there was a small chance that the skeleton was Earhart's. In 1941, British colonial authorities took detailed measurements of the bones and concluded they were from a male about 5&amp;nbsp;ft 5 in tall (165 cm).&lt;ref&gt;[http://tighar.org/Projects/Earhart/Documents/Bones_Chronology3.html &quot;Bones chronology.&quot;] ''tighar.org'', 2010.

During [[World War II]], [[US Coast Guard]] [[LORAN]] Unit 92, a radio navigation station built in the summer and fall of 1944, and operational from mid-November 1944 until mid-May 1945, was located on Gardner Island's southeast end. Dozens of U.S. Coast Guard personnel were involved in its construction and operation, but were mostly forbidden from leaving the small base or having contact with the Gilbertese colonists then on the island, and found no artifacts known to relate to Earhart.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loran-history.info/Gardner_Island/gardner.htm &quot;Loran-History, Loran Unit 92, Gardner Island.&quot;] ''loran-history.info.''

In 2012, a photograph taken in October 1937 of the reef at Nikumaroro after her disappearance was enhanced.

In 1993 a former [[Pan American World Airways|PAN AM]] pilot named Henri Keyzer-Andre published an autobiography called ''Age Of Heroes: Incredible Adventures of a PAN AM Pilot and his Greatest Triumph, Unravelling the Mystery of Amelia Earhart''. This autobiography is about himself and his flying experiences during the early period of commercial air travel. In this action-packed memoir, he vividly describes trips to Siberia and China, as well as WW II missions transporting refugees across war zones. He subsequently spent 28 years with the State Department's Federal Aviation Authority, participating in diplomatic and, occasionally, covert assignments. While in Japan to assist in reviving its aviation industry, Keyzer-Andre uncovered information, documented in this book, that led him to conclude that Amelia Earhart, whose plane vanished somewhere in the Pacific in 1937, was shot down by the Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-8038-9351-1|title=Nonfiction Book Review: Age of Heroes Incredible Adve by Henri Keyzer-Andre, Author, Hy Steirman, Author  Hastings House Book Publishers $22.5 (302p) ISBN 978-0-8038-9351-1|website=PublishersWeekly.com|access-date=2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, the [[NBC-TV]] series ''[[Unsolved Mysteries]]'' broadcast an interview with a Saipanese woman who claimed to have witnessed Earhart and Noonan's execution by Japanese soldiers. No independent confirmation or support has ever emerged for any of these claims.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refStrippel1995|Strippel 1995]], p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Purported photographs of Earhart during her captivity have been identified as either fraudulent or having been taken before her final flight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tighar.org/Projects/Earhart/forum/FAQs/captured.htm &quot;Amelia Earhart FAQ.&quot;] ''tighar.org.''

Since the end of [[World War II]], a location on [[Tinian]], which is five miles (8 km) southwest of Saipan, had been rumoured to be the grave of the two aviators. In 2004, a scientifically supported archaeological dig at the site failed to turn up any bones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tighar.org/Projects/Earhart/Tinian/tigharstinian.htm &quot;TIGHARS on Tinian.&quot;] ''tighar.org,'' November 7, 2004.

===Myths, legends, and claims===
The unresolved circumstances of Earhart's disappearance, along with her fame, attracted a great body of other claims relating to her last flight, all of which have been generally dismissed for lack of verifiable evidence. Several unsupported theories have become well known in popular culture.

====Spies for FDR====
A [[World War II]]-era movie called ''[[Flight for Freedom]]'' (1943) starring [[Rosalind Russell]] and [[Fred MacMurray]] furthered a [[mythology|myth]] that Earhart was [[spy]]ing on the Japanese in the Pacific at the request of the [[Franklin Roosevelt]] administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Common Myths&quot;/&gt;{{refn| Some authors have speculated that Earhart and Noonan were shot down by Japanese aircraft as she was thought to be spying on Japanese territory so America could supposedly plan an attack.|group=N}} By 1949, both the [[United Press]] and U.S. Army Intelligence had concluded this rumor was groundless. [[Jacqueline Cochran|Jackie Cochran]], another pioneering aviator and one of Earhart's friends, made a postwar search of numerous files in Japan and was convinced the Japanese were not involved in Earhart's disappearance.&lt;ref&gt;Cochran 1954, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tokyo Rose rumor====
A rumor which claimed that Earhart had made propaganda radio broadcasts as one of the many women compelled to serve as [[Tokyo Rose]] was investigated closely by George Putnam. According to several biographies of Earhart, Putnam investigated this rumor personally but after listening to many recordings of numerous Tokyo Roses, he did not recognize her voice among them.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refGoldsteinandDillon1997|Goldstein and Dillon 1997]], p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt;

====New Britain====
The theory that Earhart may have turned back mid-flight has been posited. She would then have tried to reach the airfield at [[Rabaul]], [[New Britain]] (northeast of mainland [[Papua New Guinea]]), approximately {{convert|2200|mi|km}} from Howland.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Enduring Mystery of Amelia Earhart's Disappearance Maybe Finally Coming To an End.&quot; ''The Atlantic Flyer'', September 2007, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, Donald Angwin, a veteran of the [[Australian Army]]'s World War II [[New Britain campaign|campaign in New Britain]], contacted researchers to suggest that a wrecked aircraft he had witnessed in jungle about {{convert|40|mi|km}} southwest of Rabaul, on April 17, 1945, may have been Earhart's Electra.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billings&quot;&gt;Billings, David. [http://www.wingsoverkansas.com/earhart/article.asp?id=850 &quot;Aircraft Search Project in Papua New Guinea.&quot;] ''Wings Over Kansas'', 2000. Retrieved: March 27, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Angwin, who was a corporal in the [[11th Battalion (Australia)|11th Battalion]] at the time,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/Veteran.aspx?serviceId=A&amp;veteranId=762092 &quot;Angwin, Donald Arthur.&quot;] ''Commonwealth of Australia: Military Forces,'' 2002. Retrieved: March 27, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; reported that he and other members of a forward patrol on Japanese-occupied New Britain had found a wrecked twin-engined, unpainted all-metal aircraft. The soldiers recorded a rough position on a map, along with serial numbers seen on the wreckage. While the map was located in the possession of another veteran in 1993, subsequent searches of the area indicated failed to find a wreck.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billings&quot;/&gt;

While Angwin died in 2001, David Billings, an Australian aircraft engineer, has continued to investigate his theory. Billings claims that the serial numbers written on the map, &lt;small&gt;&quot;600H/P S3HI C/N1055&quot;&lt;/small&gt;, represent:
* a {{convert|600|hp|kW|abbr=on}} [[Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1340]]-S3H1 model engine and;
* &quot;Constructor's Number 1055&quot;, an airframe identifier.
These would be consistent with a Lockheed Electra 10E, such as that flown by Earhart, although they do not contain enough information to identify the wreck in question as NR16020.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billings&quot;/&gt;

''Pacific Wrecks'', a website that documents World War II-era aircraft crash sites, notes that no Electra has been reported lost in or around Papua New Guinea. Gillespie wrote that the {{convert|2000|mi|km|adj=on}} distance from Earhart's last known position to New Britain was impossible for the aircraft to fly, requiring more than 13 hours of flight when there were only 4 hours of fuel remaining.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pacific Wrecks&quot;&gt;[http://pacificwrecks.com/aircraft/electra/earhart/  &quot;Amelia Earhart Myths from the Pacific War.&quot;] ''Pacific Wrecks'', 2011. Retrieved: March 27, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Assuming another identity====
In November 2006, the [[National Geographic Channel]] aired episode two of the ''Undiscovered History'' series about a claim that Earhart survived the world flight, moved to [[New Jersey]], changed her name, remarried and became [[Irene Craigmile Bolam]]. This claim had originally been raised in the book ''Amelia Earhart Lives'' (1970) by author Joe Klaas, based on the research of Major Joseph Gervais. Irene Bolam, who had been a banker in New York during the 1940s, denied being Earhart, filed a lawsuit requesting $1.5&amp;nbsp;million in damages and submitted a lengthy [[affidavit]] in which she refuted the claims. The book's publisher, [[McGraw-Hill]], withdrew the book from the market shortly after it was released and court records indicate that they made an out-of-court settlement with her.&lt;ref&gt;Gillespie, Ric. [http://tighar.org/Projects/Earhart/Books/BookReviews/earhartsurvive.html &quot;Amelia Earhart Survived by Colonel Rollin Reineck, USAF (ret.), 2003.&quot;] ''tighar.org.''

Retrieved: July 10, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Bolam's personal life history was thoroughly documented by researchers, eliminating any possibility she was Earhart. Kevin Richlin, a professional criminal forensic expert hired by ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'', studied photographs of both women and cited many measurable facial differences between Earhart and Bolam.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refStrippel1995|Strippel 1995]], pp. 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Earhart was a widely known international celebrity during her lifetime. Her shyly charismatic appeal, independence, persistence, coolness under pressure, courage and goal-oriented career along with the circumstances of her disappearance at a comparatively early age have driven her lasting [[celebrity|fame]] in [[popular culture]]. Hundreds of articles and scores of books have been written about her life which is often cited as a motivational tale, especially for girls. Earhart is generally regarded as a feminist icon.&lt;ref&gt;Hamill 1976, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Earhart's accomplishments in aviation inspired a generation of female aviators, including the more than 1,000 women pilots of the [[Women Airforce Service Pilots]] (WASP) who ferried military aircraft, towed gliders, flew target practice aircraft, and served as transport pilots during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refRegis2008|Regis 2008]], pp. 102–105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haynsworth and Toomey 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

The home where Earhart was born is now the [[Amelia Earhart Birthplace Museum]] and is maintained by The Ninety-Nines, an international group of female pilots of whom Earhart was the first elected president.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amelia Earhart Birthplace Museum—Atchison, KS&quot;&gt;[http://theyellowbrickroadtrip.blogspot.com/2009/04/amelia-earhart-birthplace-museum.html &quot;The Yellow Brick Road Trip.&quot;] ''theyellowbrickroadtrip.blogspot.com''. Retrieved: July 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A small section of Earhart's Lockheed Electra starboard engine nacelle recovered in the aftermath of the Hawaii crash has been confirmed as authentic and is now regarded as a control piece that will help to authenticate possible future discoveries. The evaluation of the scrap of metal was featured on an episode of ''[[History Detectives]]'' on Season 7 in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/investigations/706_ameliaearhart.html &quot;Amelia Earhart's plane.&quot;] ''[[History Detectives]]'', 2009. Retrieved: July 24, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memorial flights===
Two notable memorial flights by female aviators subsequently followed Earhart's original [[circumnavigation]]al route.
*In 1967, [[Ann Pellegreno|Ann Dearing Holtgren Pellegreno]] and a crew of three successfully flew a similar aircraft (a Lockheed 10A Electra) to complete a world flight that closely mirrored Earhart's flight plan. On the 30th anniversary of her disappearance, Pellegreno dropped a wreath in Earhart's honor over tiny Howland Island and returned to Oakland, completing the {{convert|28000|mi|km|sing=on}} commemorative flight on July 7, 1967.
*In 1997, on the 60th anniversary of Earhart's world flight, San Antonio businesswoman [[Linda Finch]] retraced the final flight path flying the same make and model of aircraft as Earhart, a restored 1935 Lockheed Electra 10E. Finch touched down in 18 countries before finishing the trip two and a half months later when she arrived back at Oakland Airport on May 28, 1997.

In 2001, another commemorative flight retraced the route undertaken by Earhart in her August 1928 transcontinental record flight. Dr. Carlene Mendieta flew an original Avro Avian, the same type that was used in 1928.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mendieta&quot;/&gt;

In 2013, [[Amelia Rose Earhart]], a pilot and reporter from Denver Colorado, announced that she would be recreating the 1937 flight during the Summer of 2014 in a single engine Pilatus PC-12NG.  She completed the flight without incident on July 11, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flywithamelia.org/ &quot;2014 Round-the-world Flight.&quot;] ''Amelia Flight'', June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Henry K.

===Other honors===
Countless other tributes and memorials have been made in Amelia Earhart's name, including a 2012 tribute from [[Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]], speaking at a State Department event celebrating the ties of Earhart and the United States to its Pacific neighbors, noting: &quot;Earhart ... created a legacy that resonates today for anyone, girls and boys, who dreams of the stars.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://iipdigital.usembassy.gov/st/english/article/2012/03/201203202478.html &quot;Earhart broke social and aviation barriers, Clinton says.&quot;] ''[[U.S. Department of State]]'', 20 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, [[Flying Magazine|''Flying'' magazine]] ranked Earhart No. 9 on their list of the &quot;51 Heroes of Aviation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flyingmag.com/photo-gallery/photos/51-heroes-aviation?pnid=41846 &quot;51 Heroes of Aviation&quot; Amelia Earhrt.&quot;] ''Flying'', September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The following list is not considered definitive, but serves also to give significant examples of tributes and honors.

==Books by Earhart==
Earhart was a successful and heavily promoted writer who served as aviation editor for ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' magazine from 1928 to 1930. She wrote magazine articles, newspaper columns, essays and published two books based upon her experiences as a flyer during her lifetime:
* ''[[20 Hrs., 40 Min.]]'' (1928) was a journal of her experiences as the first woman passenger on a transatlantic flight.
*''[[The Fun of It]]'' (1932) was a memoir of her flying experiences and an essay on women in aviation.
*''[[Last Flight (book)|Last Flight]]'' (1937) featured the periodic journal entries she sent back to the United States during her world flight attempt, published in newspapers in the weeks prior to her final departure from [[New Guinea]]. Compiled by her husband GP Putnam after she disappeared over the Pacific, many historians consider this book to be only partially Earhart's original work.

'''Elmo Russell &quot;Bud&quot; Zumwalt Jr.''' (November 29, 1920 – January 2, 2000) was an American naval officer and the youngest man to serve as [[Chief of Naval Operations]]. As an [[Admiral (United States)|admiral]] and later the 19th [[Chief of Naval Operations]], Zumwalt played a major role in U.S. military history, especially during the [[Vietnam War]]. A decorated war veteran, Zumwalt reformed U.S. Navy personnel policies in an effort to improve enlisted life and ease racial tensions. After he retired from a 32-year Navy career, he launched an unsuccessful campaign for the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]].

==Early life and education==
Zumwalt was born in [[San Francisco, California]], the son of Elmo Russell Zumwalt, M.D., and his wife, Frances Pearl (Frank) Zumwalt, M.D., both country doctors.&lt;ref&gt;''Contemporary Authors Online'', Gale, 2009. Reproduced in Biography Resource Center. [[Farmington Hills, Michigan]]: Gale, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/visaliatimesdelta/obituary.aspx?pid=163784539&lt;/ref&gt; Frances was raised Jewish, the daughter of Julius and Sarah Frank of [[Burlington, Vermont]]. Her family moved to [[Los Angeles, California]], where she grew up. She became estranged from her parents for marrying outside the faith, as the Zumwalts were Christian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berman|first=Larry|title=Zumwalt: The Life and Times of Admiral Elmo Russell &quot;Bud&quot; Zumwalt Jr.|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zumwalt, an [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] and recipient of the [[Distinguished Eagle Scout Award]] from the [[Scouting in California|Boy Scouts of America]], attended [[Tulare Union High School]] in [[Tulare, California]], where he became the [[valedictorian]], and [[Rutherford Preparatory School]] in [[Long Beach, California]].

==Entrance into the US Navy==
Zumwalt had planned to become a doctor like his parents, but in 1939, he was accepted to the [[United States Naval Academy]] at [[Annapolis, Maryland]]. As a [[midshipman]] at the USNA, he was president of the Trident Society, vice president of the Quarterdeck Society and the two-time winner of the June Week Public Speaking Contest (1940–41). Zumwalt also participated in intercollegiate debating and was a Company Commander (1941) and Regimental Three Striper (1942). He graduated with distinction and was [[Commissioned officer|commissioned]] as an [[ensign (rank)|ensign]] on June 19, 1942. He also received an honorary degree from [[Texas Tech]] University.

==World War II==
Zumwalt was assigned to [[USS Phelps (DD-360)|USS ''Phelps'' (DD-360), a destroyer]]. In August 1943, ''Phelps'' was detached for instruction in the [[Operational Training Command]]-Pacific in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. In January 1944, Zumwalt reported for duty onboard [[USS Robinson (DD-562)|USS ''Robinson'']]. On this ship, he was awarded the [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]] with [[Valor device]] for ''heroic service as Evaluator in the Combat Information Center ...in action against enemy Japanese battleships during the Battle for Leyte Gulf, October 25, 1944.''

After the end of World War II in August 1945, Zumwalt continued to serve until December 8, 1945, as the [[prize crew]] officer of the [[Japanese gunboat Ataka|''Ataka'']], a 1,200-ton Japanese river [[gunboat]] with a crew of 200. In this capacity, he took the first American-controlled ship since the outbreak of World War II up the [[Huangpu River]] to [[Shanghai]], China. There, they helped to restore order and assisted in disarming the Japanese.

==Command assignments==
Zumwalt next served as [[executive officer]] of the destroyer [[USS Saufley (DD-465)|USS ''Saufley'']], and in March 1946, was transferred to the destroyer [[USS Zellars (DD-777)|USS ''Zellars'']], as Executive Officer and Navigator.

In January 1948, he was assigned to the [[ROTC|Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps]] Unit of the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]], where he remained until June 1950. That same month, he assumed command of [[USS Tills (DE-748)|USS ''Tills'']], a destroyer escort that was commissioned in a reserve status. The Tillis was placed in full active commission at [[Charleston Naval Shipyard]] on November 21, 1950, and he continued to command her until March 1951, when he joined the battleship [[USS Wisconsin (BB-64)|USS ''Wisconsin'']] as Navigator and served with the ship in operations in Korea.

Detached from USS ''Wisconsin'' in June 1952, he attended the [[Naval War College]], [[Newport, Rhode Island]], and in June 1953, he reported as Head of the Shore and Overseas Bases Section, [[Bureau of Naval Personnel]], Navy Department, [[Washington, D.C.]] He also served as Officer and Enlisted Requirements Officer, and as Action Officer on Medicare Legislation. Completing that tour of duty in July 1955, he assumed command of the destroyer [[USS Arnold J. Isbell (DD-869)|USS ''Arnold J. Isbell'']], participating in two deployments with the U.S. [[Seventh Fleet]]. In this assignment, he was commended by the Commander, Cruiser-Destroyer Forces, [[U.S. Pacific Fleet]], for winning the Battle Efficiency Competition for his ship and for winning Excellence Awards in Engineering, Gunnery, Anti-Submarine Warfare, and Operations. In July 1957, he returned to the Bureau of Naval Personnel for further duty. In December 1957, he was transferred to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Personnel and Reserve Forces), and served as Special Assistant for Naval Personnel until November 1958, then as Special Assistant and Naval Aide until August 1959.

Ordered to the first ship built from the keel up as a [[guided missile frigate]], [[USS Dewey (DLG-14)|USS ''Dewey'' (DLG-14)]], built at the [[Bath Iron Works|Bath (Maine) Iron Works]], he assumed command of that frigate at her commissioning in December 1959 and commanded her until June 1961. During this period of his command, Dewey earned the Excellence Award in Engineering, Supply, Weapons, and was runner-up in the Battle Efficiency Competition. He was a student at the [[National War College]], Washington, D. C., during the 1961–1962 class year. In June 1962, he was assigned to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (International Security Affairs), Washington, D.C., where he served first as Desk Officer for [[France]], [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]], then as Director of Arms Control and Contingency Planning for [[Cuba]]. From December 1963 until June 21, 1965, he served as Executive Assistant and Senior Aide to the Honorable [[Paul Nitze|Paul H. Nitze]], [[Secretary of the Navy]]. For duty in his tour in the offices of the [[Secretary of Defense]] and the Secretary of the Navy, he was awarded the [[Legion of Merit]].

==Flag assignments==

===Vietnam===
After his selection for the rank of [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]], Zumwalt assumed command of [[Cruiser-Destroyer Flotilla Seven]] on 24 July 1965 in San Diego.&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Zumwalt, 154&lt;/ref&gt; He then served as Director, Systems Analysis Division, OPNAV (OP-96) from August 1966 to August 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Zumwalt, 433.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1968, he became Commander [[Naval Forces Vietnam|Naval Forces, Vietnam]], and Chief of the Naval Advisory Group, U.S. [[Military Assistance Command Vietnam]] (MACV) and was promoted to Vice Admiral in October 1968. Vice Admiral Zumwalt was the Navy adviser to General [[Creighton Abrams]], Commander, MACV. Zumwalt always spoke very highly of Abrams, and said that Abrams was the most caring officer he had ever known.

Zumwalt's command was not a [[blue-water navy|blue-water]] force, like the Seventh Fleet; it was a [[brown-water navy|brown-water]] unit: he commanded the flotilla of [[Fast Patrol Craft|Swift Boats]] that patrolled the coasts, harbors, and rivers of Vietnam. Among the swift-boat commanders were his son, Elmo Russell Zumwalt III, and later future Senator and U.S. Secretary of State [[John Kerry]]. Among his other forces were [[Task Force 115]], the Coastal Surveillance Force, Task Force 116, the River Patrol Force, and Task Force 117, the joint Army-Navy Mobile Riverine Force.&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Zumwalt, 171&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chief of Naval Operations===
President [[Richard Nixon]] nominated Zumwalt to be [[Chief of Naval Operations]] in April 1970. Upon being relieved as Commander Naval Forces, Vietnam, on May 15, 1970, he was awarded a second [[Navy Distinguished Service Medal]] for exceptionally meritorious service.

He assumed duties as [[Chief of Naval Operations]] and was promoted to full [[Admiral]] on July 1, 1970, and quickly began a series of moves intended to reduce racism and sexism in the Navy. These were disseminated in Navy-wide communications known as &quot;Z-grams&quot;. These included orders authorizing beards (sideburns, mustaches, and longer groomed hair were also acceptable) and introducing beer-dispensing machines to barracks. Not all of these changes were well received by senior naval personnel.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} The measures to reduce discrimination against women and racial minorities were adamantly opposed by some.

Zumwalt instituted the 'Mod Squad' - [[Destroyer Squadron 26]] and later 31 - to give promising young officers early command experience. Billets were a rank lower than normal.

Zumwalt reshaped the Navy's effort to replace large numbers of aging World War II-era vessels, a plan called &quot;High-Low.&quot; Instituted over the resistance of Admiral [[Hyman Rickover]] and others, High-Low sought to balance the purchase of high-end, nuclear-powered vessels with low-end, cheaper ones —- such as the [[Sea Control Ship]]—that could be bought in greater numbers. Rickover, the Father of the Nuclear Navy, preferred buying a few major ships to buying many ordinary ones. Zumwalt proposed four kinds of warships to fit the plan; in the end, only the [[Pegasus class hydrofoil|''Pegasus'' class]] of missile patrol boats and the [[Oliver Hazard Perry class frigate|''Oliver Hazard Perry'' (FFG 7) class]] of [[frigate|guided missile frigates]] became reality, and only six out of the planned 100+ ''Pegasus'' class [[hydrofoil]]s were built. But the ''Perrys'' stood as the most populous class of U.S. warships since World War II until the advent of the [[Arleigh Burke class destroyer|''Arleigh Burke'' (DDG 51) destroyers]]. He was the last Chief of Naval Operations to live in [[Number One Observatory Circle]] before it became the official residence to the vice president. For Zumwalt, not pleased with the choice, this was reason enough to challenge Virginia Senator [[Harry F. Byrd Jr.]] in the 1976 Senate election in Virginia.&lt;ref name=&quot;google&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Barbara Bush: A Memoir|author=Bush, B.|date=2010|publisher=Scribner|isbn=9781451603958|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q0qdrPsi0eEC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elmo Zumwalt Jr. retired from the Navy on July 1, 1974, aged 53.

==Later years==
In [[United States Senate elections, 1976|1976]], he unsuccessfully ran as a [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] candidate for the [[United States Senate]] from [[Virginia]], and was defeated by incumbent independent senator [[Harry F. Byrd Jr.]] by a 57% to 38% result. Later, he held the presidency of the [[American Medical Building Corporation]] in [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]].

==Family and Agent Orange controversy==
While serving in Shanghai in 1945, Zumwalt met and married Mouza Coutelais-du-Roche, whose French-Russian family was living there. She returned with him to the United States. They had four children: [[Elmo Russell Zumwalt III]], [http://jamesgzumwalt.com James Gregory Zumwalt] ; Ann F. Zumwalt Coppola and Mouzetta C. Zumwalt-Weathers.

Zumwalt's eldest son, Elmo Zumwalt III, served as [[Lieutenant (junior grade)|lieutenant]] on one of Zumwalt's patrol boats during the Vietnam War. In January 1983, he was diagnosed with [[lymphoma]], and in 1985 it was discovered that he also had [[Hodgkin's disease]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/14/obituaries/elmo-r-zumwalt-3d-42-is-dead-father-ordered-agent-orange-use.html New York Times, August 14, 1988: ''Elmo R. Zumwalt 3d, 42, Is Dead; Father Ordered Agent Orange Use''] Linked 2014-09-07&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, his son Elmo Russell Zumwalt IV had been born in 1977 with severe learning disabilities. Admiral Zumwalt and his family were convinced that both son and grandson were victims of [[Agent Orange]], which the admiral had ordered to be sprayed over the Mekong Delta to kill vegetation and drive &quot;the Viet Cong back 1,000 yards off the water's edge.&quot;&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

In an article published in The New York Times in 1986, Elmo Zumwalt III said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I am a lawyer and I don't think I could prove in court, by the weight of the existing scientific evidence, that Agent Orange is the cause of all the medical problems - nervous disorders, cancer and skin problems - reported by Vietnam veterans, or of their children's severe birth defects. But I am convinced that it is.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Admiral Zumwalt and his son collaborated with writer [[John Pekkanen]] to create the book ''My Father, My Son'', published by MacMillan in September 1986, where they discussed the family tragedy of his son's battle with cancer. In 1988, the book was made into a TV movie with the same name, starring [[Karl Malden]] as the admiral and [[Keith Carradine]] as his son.&lt;ref name=IMDb&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095685/combined IMDb: ''My Father, My Son (1988)''] Linked 2014-09-07&lt;/ref&gt;

Elmo Zumwalt III died from his cancer on August 14, 1988, at the age of 42,&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; three months after the TV movie was shown.&lt;ref name=IMDb/&gt;

During his son's illness in the early 1980s, Admiral Zumwalt was very active in lobbying Congress to establish a national registry of bone marrow donors. Such donors serve patients who do not have suitably matched bone marrow donors in their families. This was ultimately a disinterested act, since his son was able to receive a transplant from his own sister, but many patients don't have close relatives who are able and willing to help in this heroic way. His efforts were a major factor in the founding of the [[National Marrow Donor Program]] (NMDP) in July 1986. Admiral Zumwalt was the first chairman of the NMDP's Board of Directors.

In his later years, Zumwalt resided in [[Arlington County, Virginia]].

==Books==
After he retired, Zumwalt wrote ''[[On Watch: a Memoir]],'' published by Quadrangle Books in 1976. It reviews his Navy career and includes reprints of all the Z-Grams he issued as CNO.

==Death==
[[File:Defense.gov News Photo 000110-N-7495A-007.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Zumwalt's casket being carried by pallbearers at his funeral in January 2000.]]
Zumwalt died on January 2, 2000, aged 79, at the [[Duke University Medical Center]] in [[Durham, North Carolina]] from [[mesothelioma]]. Most likely, at some time in his naval career, Zumwalt was exposed to [[asbestos]], which was widely used on naval vessels until it was banned during the 1980s after its hazards became widely known.

His funeral service was held at the [[Naval Academy Chapel]]. In his eulogy President Bill Clinton called Zumwalt &quot;the conscience of the United States Navy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ClintonEu&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=58232 | title=William J. Clinton: &quot;Remarks at Funeral Services for Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr. in Annapolis, Maryland,&quot; January 10, 2000 | publisher=The American Presidency Project | accessdate=2013-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The United States Navy's [[DD(X)]] [[guided missile destroyer]] program has been named the Zumwalt class in his honor, and its lead ship will bear his name [[USS Zumwalt (DDG-1000)|USS ''Zumwalt'']] by Navy tradition.

In 2013, the Mesothelioma Center for Excellence at the VA West Los Angeles Medical Center was renamed the Elmo Zumwalt Treatment &amp; Research Center specializing in mesothelioma research, particularly for veterans who may have been exposed to asbestos during their service.

* Zumwalt's picture hangs in the [[War Remnants Museum (Ho Chi Minh City)|War Remnants Museum]] in Ho Chi Minh City, near pictures of [[John Kerry]], [[Robert McNamara]], [[Warren Christopher]], and other American dignitaries, in commemoration of a visit he made after normalization of relations between Vietnam and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://daily.nysun.com/Repository/getmailfiles.asp?Style%3DOliveXLib%3AArticleToMail%26Type%3Dtext%2Fhtml%26Path%3DNYS%2F2004%2F08%2F16%26ID%3DAr00100 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 9, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516203647/http://daily.nysun.com/Repository/getmailfiles.asp?Style=OliveXLib:ArticleToMail&amp;Type=text/html&amp;Path=NYS/2004/08/16&amp;ID=Ar00100 |archivedate=May 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In his first book, ''On Watch'', Zumwalt quoted at length an interview with Admiral [[Hyman G. Rickover]], regarded as the [[Father of the Nuclear Navy]] and who interviewed all officers with responsibilities involving nuclear propulsion. Rickover and Zumwalt had a combative conversation, with Zumwalt referring to it as a humbling experience.
* Zumwalt was a member of [[Sigma Phi Epsilon]] fraternity. He was initiated in 1980.
* In 1994 the U.S. Navy Memorial Foundation awarded Zumwalt its Lone Sailor Award for his distinguished naval career.
